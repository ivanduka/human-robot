7. Where residual effects have been predicted, identify whether those residual effects would be likely to act in combination with the effects of other physical facilities or activities and expand on the matters described above as appropriate. The description of vegetated lands does not include industrial lands.

Vegetation community descriptions must apply the most relevant and up to date ecological classification or mapping system. Reference any available provincial or territorial inventory and mapping standards and guidelines.

Engagement with potentially affected Indigenous communities may provide further information. Conservation status (provincial and COSEWIC) of ecological communities as well as plant species must be noted.

Explain how communities in the study area were delineated (i.e., existing mapping, remote sensing interpretation, or field mapping).

Indicate the date of spatial data collection.

Provide justification if field work was not carried out.

The effects analysis on vegetation must consider:

change in vegetation cover caused by the project;

weed control measures (e.g., prevention, treatment);
avoidance of any sensitive or rare communities and important individuals (e.g., vegetation important to wildlife); and
seed mixes and replanting for re-vegetation purposes.
Native and indigenous species adapted to local conditions should be used when the goal of revegetation is to naturalize or regenerate the area.

Vegetation control programs, including the frequency of work, monitoring and inspection of RoW vegetation conditions, and control procedures, must consider:

the nature of the vegetation cover (e.g., species mix, characteristics) occurring along the RoW, and variations over different biogeographical areas;
the promotion or inhibition of different plant communities (naturally low or slow growing plant species versus predominantly tall or fast growing species); and
the application of other integrated vegetation management practices.
If herbicides or other chemicals may be used, consider:

the criteria for their use;

withdrawal or discharge needs for the proposed project; and
any potential inter-basin transfers that might introduce undesirable biota.
In addition to meeting the requirements of s. 24 of the OPR by obtaining permits for hydrostatic testing, applicants must consider hydrostatic test water needs and management in its environmental effects assessment. Where the final details of hydrostatic testing have yet to be confirmed, applicants must still identify their expected needs, options available to them and the criteria they intend to apply to ensure protection of water resources.

Applicants may identify any alternative sources of water (e.g., recycled or brackish water) for the project. Also consider the potential to reuse test water from section to section for pipe testing.

Project interactions with groundwater may result from crossing a shallow water table or specific project activities (e.g., blasting). In these cases, consider the spatial extent and depth levels as well as water characteristics (e.g., salinity).

Consider and describe whether the project may affect evaporation and transpiration rates and therefore affect surface land use, especially in agricultural areas.

Where an authorization is required from DFO, outline any appropriate offsetting and monitoring.

Where effects on fish and fish habitat may affect human health, see Table A-3.

DFO has several guidance documents and information pieces that could be useful in dealing with fish and fish habitat. Please refer to the DFO National website for applicable materials and guidance.

The document Pipeline Associated Watercourse Crossings (5th Edition) – endorsed by DFO – provides guidance on best practices and meeting regulatory requirements. This document may be obtained through the CER, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association (CEPA) or the Canadian Gas Association (CGA)."
wildlife,"Identify wildlife species of ecological, economic or human importance in the study area. Also describe the:

diversity, distribution and location;

function;
location;
suitability;
structure;
diversity;

7. Further, with respect to cumulative effects:

Describe the cumulative disturbance footprint of proposed and future physical facilities and activities within known key habitats (e.g., migration corridors, denning or calving areas, feeding areas) and distribution of that footprint, quantitatively where possible. Describe the effects on the connectivity of key habitats.
Describe the cumulative effects on wildlife that could occur as a result of the timing of the proposed project in combination with other physical facilities or activities.
Describe how cumulative changes in access would affect wildlife mortality risk or habitat quantity and quality.
Compare the cumulative effect on each species assessed to any available species-specific thresholds or policies, and indicate to what degree a threshold is approached or exceeded. The identification and description of wildlife presence in the area must include, but not be limited to, resident, temporary (e.g., migratory), unique species or populations, and umbrella and keystone species. Mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and invertebrates may be relevant. The identification and description of wildlife of human importance must also consider consumptive (e.g., hunting, harvesting) and non-consumptive (e.g., bird-watching) values, as well as species of importance to potentially affected Indigenous communities.

The identification, description and quantification of habitat must include, but not be limited to:

breeding or rutting grounds,
nesting and denning sites;
wintering grounds;
hibernation or hibernaculum sites;
moulting, migration and staging areas;
movement corridors;
mineral licks; and
trees important to wildlife (e.g., bat trees).
Other sensitive areas and habitats include:

wetlands (and associated upland habitats);
riparian habitat;
forest interior habitat;
old growth; and
grasslands / native prairie.
The effects analysis regarding wildlife and wildlife habitat must consider factors such as:

ecosystem functions;
the timing of construction activities in relation to sensitive periods for wildlife (e.g., migratory bird breeding season);
varying degrees of wildlife habitat loss;
changes in habitat quality (e.g., fragmentation, edge effects);
changes in human access;
disturbance to wildlife, including sensory (light and noise) disturbance from operation of above-ground facilities, including on birds and nocturnal species; and,
direct and indirect wildlife mortality.
Ensure spatial boundaries for the study area and assessment are specific to the valued component and ecologically defensible (e.g., winter range boundaries, migration routes, fawning and calving areas).

When calculating the disturbance footprint or linear disturbance density, remember to include the total avoidance area experienced by the valued component, which may be considerably larger than the physical footprint itself depending on the valued component.

Temporal considerations are also relevant. For example, effects on wildlife from noise and sensory disturbance, water usage or divergence, or waste stream emissions to air, land or water can be exacerbated by having a number of projects taking place simultaneously (or continuously over more than one season) in a watershed, breeding area or migratory pathway.

Increased access to project areas, whether temporary or permanent, affects wildlife habitat, populations, distribution and interactions. Access may include not only human access but increased ease of access by predators or competing species.

Examples of tools that may be used to assess cumulative effects on valued components include scenario-based models, spatial analysis using a geographic information system, and landscape level indicators of change (e.g., linear density) (see the CEA Agency’s Cumulative Effects Practitioners Guide, 1999).

Applicants should note the requirements of applicable provincial, territorial and federal regulations (e.g., the federal Migratory Birds Regulations).

species,"For effects related to wildlife, fish and plant species at risk or species of special status:

identify the species and their status;
provide the appropriate references to the SARA Schedules, or Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC), provincial or territorial listing;
identify their habitat(s), including any critical habitat(s) identified in a Recovery Strategy or an Action Plan listed on the SARA public registry;
determine whether the species, its habitat, or the residences of those species could be affected by project activities;
if not, explain why not;
if yes, describe any predicted effects;
identify any critical timing windows (e.g., denning, rutting or spawning), setback distances, or other restrictions;
identify if a provincial, territorial or federal (e.g., SARA) permit will be required; and
identify any proposed mitigative measures (e.g., improved project design or construction timing or compensation plan).
2. Where the project may result in the destruction of any part of the critical habitat of a wildlife species listed on Schedule 1 of SARA, describe:

any discussions with the appropriate Federal Authority (Environment and Climate Change Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Parks Canada) on obtaining a permit under s. 73 of the SARA;
all reasonable alternatives to the project that would avoid the effect on the species’ critical habitat; and
all feasible measures that will be taken to eliminate the effect of the work or activity on the species’ critical habitat.
3. Where residual effects have been predicted, identify whether those residual effects would be likely to act in combination with the effects of other physical works or activities and expand on the matters described above as appropriate.Many rare species (e.g., endangered or threatened species under the SARA) are at risk in large part as a result of the past cumulative effects on their population or habitat. Their inclusion on official lists reflects their status as having crossed a threshold requiring special actions for their protection and recovery. Any additional residual effects have the potential to further contribute to this existing situation. Consequently, proposed projects must preferably avoid, or fully mitigate or compensate for any residual project contribution to cumulative effects.

Status refers to designation under federal, provincial or territorial legislation or guidelines (e.g., extirpated, endangered, threatened or of special concern).

Consult the SARA public registry for Schedule 1, the List of Wildlife Species at Risk, and Schedules 2 and 3 of SARA. Consult with Environment and Climate Change Canada (Canadian Wildlife Service), Fisheries and Oceans Canada, or Parks Canada on species at risk or their critical habitat in the study area.

Where critical habitat has not been defined, field studies may be necessary, as well as identifying, with federal, provincial or territorial authorities, mitigation measures that effectively avoid sensitive interaction periods or activities. Field surveys may be useful in identifying mitigation needs or locally common populations not substantially affected.

For species at risk listed on Schedule 1 of SARA, the proposed mitigative measures must be consistent with any applicable Recovery Strategies and Action Plans listed on the SARA public registry.

Consult with appropriate provincial or territorial authorities on species listed under those jurisdictions.

For species at risk with no recovery strategy or action plan, applicants should use the best available information, such as COSEWIC status reports, draft recovery strategies or action plans, existing plans or input from the recovery team and specific advice (or management plans) from any jurisdiction that manages the species. Describe how measures to avoid, fully mitigate or compensate project effects would align with the best available information. When relying on compensation plans, describe the details of engagement with relevant experts, the options available, and criteria for selecting the options relied on, and for assessing the adequacy (sufficiency and validity) of any compensation measures or offsets.

Applicants should conduct a thorough inventory of all areas potentially affected by the project that are expected to support any species at risk or species of special status. Consult federal, provincial, territorial, regional and local databases (e.g., conservation data centres) and any other information associated with species of special status. Species data in existing databases may not be systematically collected or updated and, therefore, a database search may not be sufficient to support a conclusion about the absence of a species in the area.

Additional guidance, including direction to relevant federal, provincial, territorial and other related information, is available from the COSEWIC and Environment and Climate Change Canada."
