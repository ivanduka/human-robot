Several bird and amphibian species observed using wetland. Evidence of mammal use identified throughout wetland - Wetland has achieved pre-construction contours with no ponding or erosion issues throughout. Off ROW vegetation successfully encroaching across ROW; biodiversity maintained. - Treed Bog on ROW from KP 47+900 to 49+300 appears to be at baseline (pre-construction) conditions with no net loss of wetland function observed.

Previous year assessment of sparser vegetation cover on elevated ditch roach remains but grasses and shrubs emerging on areas that have slightly settled. Leave vegetation emergence for natural recovery as ditch roach settles over time; no issues. - Vegetation throughout wetland on ROW consisting of graminoids, alder, willows, horsetails, broadleaf shrubs, sphagnum mosses, Labrador tea and black spruce. - No noxious weeds were identified within wetland. - Trench crown present through wetland but has settled as a result of hydrological influence with sufficient cross-drains present for hydrology to be maintained across the ROW; no issues of hydrologic connectivity were noted. - Substrate within wetland appears healthy through uniform vegetation cover.
