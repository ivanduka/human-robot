Chainage 1+250 to 1+450,Visible roach atop pipeline trench with subsidence present on either side.  Tension cracks. Poorly constructed water bars.,Risk of erosion and restrictions to vegetation growth.,Re-crown pipeline by redistributing the roach across the ROW to address contour issues.   Extend water bars across ROW width and beyond to carry water off the ROW.,Winter 2012 with follow-up monitoring in the Summer/Fall of 2012.,,,
Chainage 1+300,Subsidence and intersecting water bar leading to scouring directly above pipeline trench.,Continued erosion leading to pipeline exposure.,"Repair water bar, ensure adequate topsoil, and seed with appropriate seed mixture.",Winter 2012 with follow-up monitoring in the Summer/Fall of 2011.,,,
Chainage 2+800,Sloughing/sliding on the north slope above the tributary to Tupper Creek.,Continued erosion and sloughing. Sedimentation of the tributary to Tupper Creek.,Have area assessed by a qualified geotechnical engineer.,Winter/Spring 2012 with follow-up monitoring in the Summer/Fall of 2012.,,,
Chainage 2+900 to 3+000,"Poorly constructed water bars. Unmaintained erosion control structures (straw wattles, silt fences).","Continued erosion, and sedimentation of the tributary to Tupper Creek.","Install temporary ECS until such time that permanent measures can be completed. Extend water bars across ROW width and beyond to ensure water is carried off ROW. Repair silt fencing immediately adjacent to the tributary, reseed and restrict access until  vegetation  re-establishes. Remove straw wattles.",Winter 2012.
