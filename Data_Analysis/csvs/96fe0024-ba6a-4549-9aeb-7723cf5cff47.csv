(a) Slope and fill stability,Entire route,The right-of-way was recontoured to restore the − preconstruction grades and drainage channels along the remainder of the pipeline route. 8 m long scalped area observed along south boundary − of right-of-way at inspection site 2.,Unresolved,Grade scalped area and continue monitoring the reconstructed profile.,1. PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT,,
(a) Strippings / subsoil mixing,Entire route,Strippings were replaced over the stripped areas along − the pipeline route. −  Unspread strippings were observed along the south side of the right-of-way at inspection site 3. Poorly-mixed and graded trench crown from inspection − site 2 to 3.,Unresolved,"Replace strippings across adjacent bare soils. Continue monitoring the re-establishment of ground cover in 2008. Mix and smooth trench area from inspection site 2 to 3, as warranted.",2. SOIL CAPABILITY,,
(b) Degradation of soil structure and lowering of soil capability through compaction and rutting,Entire route,−  No areas of compaction or rutting were observed along the right-of-way in 2007. −  Construction activities occurred during frozen conditions.,Resolved,N/A,2. SOIL CAPABILITY,,
(c) Trench subsidence and crowning,Entire route,A slight crown was left over the trench to compensate − for settlement along the majority of the route. Excess crowning was observed along a segment near − inspection site 1.,Unresolved,"Monitor for trench subsidence, recontour where necessary.",2. SOIL CAPABILITY,,
(a) Alterations of natural flow patterns,Entire route,"The right-of-way and log deck sites were recontoured − to restore the preconstruction grades and drainage channels.  Breaks were left in the crown at obvious drainages and − areas where seepage occurs in order to minimize interference with natural drainage, and at sidehill locations along the right-of-way. All corduroy and geotextile matting along the right-of-− way was removed post-construction in order to avoid interfering with natural drainage patterns and ensure adequate cross drainage across right-of-way.",Unresolved,Continue monitoring trench settlement along the right-of-way in 2008.,3. WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY,,
(a) Potential loss or reduction of habitat and/or hydrologic function,Entire route,−  Construction occurred during frozen ground conditions. Low-lying wet areas were restored to preconstruction − profiles (inspection site 5). −  Wetlands are naturally regenerating following construction (inspection sites 14 and 19).,Resolved,N/A,4. WETLANDS,,
(a) Loss or alteration of native vegetation and vegetation important to wildlife,Entire route,"The right-of-way consists of a new 10 m wide − easement, while sharing additional workspace with the adjacent existing right-of-way where required, thereby minimizing new clearing. −  Natural revegetation is occurring along the length of the pipeline route, and native colonizers are successfully establishing ground cover along most of the right-of-way.",Resolved,N/A,5. VEGETATION,,
(b)  Weed introduction,Entire route,−  No weeds of concern were identified during the PCM program.,Unresolved,Continue monitoring for weed growth and introduction.,5. VEGETATION,,
(c) Loss of salvageable timber,Entire route,−  Minimal clearing (approximately 8.78 ha) was required as the right-of-way paralleled existing clearing for 100% of its route. −  Merchantable timber was salvaged in accordance with provincial forestry officers and local timber companies with dispositions in the area.,Resolved,N/A,5. VEGETATION,,
(a) Loss or alteration of habitat,Entire route,"−  Natural revegetation is occurring along the length of the pipeline route, and native colonizers are successfully establishing ground cover along most of the right-of-way.",Resolved,N/A,6. WILDLIFE AND WILDLIFE HABITAT,,
(b) Sensory disturbance of wildlife,Entire route,"In order to minimize the length of the open ditch and − reduce the time the trench was open, the pipeline was lowered in and the trench was backfilled soon after being excavated.",Resolved,N/A,6. WILDLIFE AND WILDLIFE HABITAT,,
(a) Loss of vascular plant species at risk or significant vascular plant communities,KP 4.7,"A Vegetation Assessment (TERA 2006) was − undertaken along the pipeline route on August 29 and 30, 2006. One listed rare plant species, golden saxifrage (Chrysosplenium iowense) (S2S3), was observed during the survey. The area was fenced-off prior to clearing and willows in − the area were not cleared. The rare plant enclosure fencing and willows were − stable at the time of the 2007 PCM, although golden saxifrage was not observed within the enclosure (inspection site 15). Impatiens sp. was observed at moderate densities − from inspection site 13 to 14. Since a rare touch-me-not species, orange touch-me-not (Impatiens aurella) (S2S3), was discovered in this area previously (TERA 2006), and since these plants were lacking features necessary for identification, it cannot be discounted that these plants may be the rare species.",Unresolved,Continue monitoring the integrity of the rare plant enclosure and conduct an early summer rare plant survey to identify Impatiens sp. Continue to avoid the rare plant enclosure and inspection sites 13 and 14 during normal Operations and Maintenance activities.,7. SPECIES AT RISK,,
"(b) Disturbance of site-specific habitat used by caribou, boreal population (Rangifer tarandus pop. 14)",Entire route,"A Wildlife Habitat Assessment (TERA 2006) was − undertaken in the vicinity of the pipeline route on August 29, 2006. One set of caribou tracks were observed along the proposed pipeline route; no other signs of caribou usage were noted. The pipeline route was aligned to parallel an existing − linear disturbance and previously disturbed lands in order to minimize the amount of new disturbance required and minimize fragmentation of habitat. −  Construction was completed as quickly as feasible to avoid prolonging disturbance in the area.",Resolved,N/A,7. SPECIES AT RISK,,
(a) Disturbance of heritage resource sites during construction,Entire route,"The previously identified archaeological site (IcRa-− t001) located approximately 100 m south of the right-of-way was not disturbed during construction. −  No new archaeological, palaeontological or historical finds were encountered along the pipeline route during construction.",Resolved,N/A,8. HERITAGE RESOURCES,,
(a) Loss or alteration of traditional land use sites,Entire route,−  No traditional land use sites were identified prior to construction or disturbed during construction.,Resolved,N/A,9. TRADITIONAL LAND USE,,
