July 26, 2014 – Observed effective weed control on ROW.","June 16, 2015 - RoW is well vegetated, approximately 85% vegetation cover on RoW compared to off RoW control.  Minor non-contiguous areas of reduced vegetation cover. – Common, non-noxious weeds observed in limited densities. Tall buttercup identified from KP 8+700 to 9+530 -more concentrated on West side of RoW, recommend spot spraying.   - Previously noted, 2014, erosion within cross drain extending across RoW at KP 9+160, is consistent with previous assessment.
