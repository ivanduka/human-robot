The contours did not appear to have been restored and very little vegetation was regenerating. It appears that the newly constructed pipeline that is paralleling and sharing the Project right-of-way has not completed final clean-up. This location is unresolved for rare plants. Perennial sow-thistle, annual hawk’s-beard and horseweed observed on right-of-way from KP 20.85 to KP 21.30. See Plate 4.","Further monitoring is recommended for rare plants.

NW 34-96-7,Shrubby Bog,"Limited vegetation establishment, dry soil conditions",The wetland from KP 21.15 to KP 21.22 is observed to be in non-functional condition due to limited vegetation establishment and dry soil conditions caused by the presence of two existing pipelines on either side of the wetland and a paved access road to the north of the wetland.

Originally this location supported three sub-populations with thousands of individuals. Due to low vegetation regeneration overall and the greatly reduced numbers of rare plant individuals compared to the original population, this location is considered unresolved. The hydrology in the area appeared to have been altered by all of the construction in the area.",Further rare plant monitoring is recommended in 2013.,,,
