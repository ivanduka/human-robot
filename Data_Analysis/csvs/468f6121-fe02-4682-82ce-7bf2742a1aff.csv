Environmental Issues,Location,Mitigative Measures Implemented,Status,Proposed 2008 Post-Construction Measures,VEC,GIS,Topic
(a) alteration of natural flow patterns,Entire route,"The right-of-way was recontoured to restore the • preconstruction grades and drainage channels.  Rutting occurring at log decks due to log haulers was • regraded. Breaks were left in the crown at obvious drainages and • areas where seepage occurs in order to minimize interference with natural drainage, and at sidehill locations along the right-of-way. All corduroy and geotextile matting along the right-of-• way was removed post-construction in order to avoid interfering with natural drainage patterns and ensure adequate cross drainage across right-of-way.",Resolved,N/A,1. WATER QUANTITY AND QUALITY,,
(a)  reduction of water quality,Pipeline crossing of small drainages (KP 2.5 and KP 5.5),"Temporary silt fences were erected near approaches at • all drainage crossings, prior to initiating crossings. Temporary bridge matting was installed for the small • drainages at KP 2.5 and KP 5.5, and was removed post-construction.",Unresolved,"SRepair silt fencing along small drainage at KP 2.5, and continue monitoring the effectiveness of the repaired erosion control measures. ilt fencing repaired as of September 2007. (Beatty pers. comm.)",2. FISH AND FISH HABITAT,,
(b) alteration of instream and riparian habitat,Pipeline crossing of small drainages (KP 2.5 and KP 5.5),"Coconut cloth was installed after construction to protect • banks from erosion at the small drainage at KP 5.5. Approach slopes of the small drainage at KP 2.5 were • seeded, while banks and slopes of the small drainages at KP 5.0 and KP 5.5 did not appear to be seeded. The disturbed areas of the bed and banks of the small • drainages at KP 5.0 and KP 5.5 were restored to preconstruction profile.",Unresolved,"Continue monitoring the effectiveness of the erosion control measures; reseed banks and slopes, if warranted.",2. FISH AND FISH HABITAT,,
(a) loss or alteration of vegetation important to wildlife,Entire route,Minimal clearing (approximately 9 ha) was required as • the right-of-way paralleled existing clearing for 95% of its route. Natural recovery occurring along the length of the right-• of-way in Alberta and in BC. Few low-growing shrubs and grasses were observed • along the right-of-way at the time of the post-construction monitoring program.,Unresolved,Continue monitoring the re-establishment of low-growing shrubs and grasses on the right-of-way for browse for ungulates.,3. VEGETATION,,
(b) weed introduction and spread,Entire route,No weeds of concern were identified during the post-• construction monitoring program.,Unresolved,Continue monitoring for weed growth and introduction.,3. VEGETATION,,
(a) loss or alteration of potential wildlife habitat,Entire route,Minimal clearing (approximately (9 ha) was required as • the right-of-way paralleled existing clearing for 95% of its route. Natural recovery occurring along the length of the right-• of-way in Alberta and in BC. Few low-growing shrubs and grasses were observed • along the right-of-way at the time of the post-construction monitoring program.,Unresolved,Continue monitoring the re-establishment of low-growing shrubs and grasses on the right-of-way for browse for ungulates.,4. WILDLIFE AND WILDLIFE HABITAT,,
(a) strippings/subsoil mixing,Entire route,"Strippings were windrowed along the spoil side of the • right-of-way with openings left at watercourses, game trails, and where sidehills were encountered. Trenching activities during wet conditions resulted in the • spoil pile slumping off the right-of-way by approximately 1 m. A Temporary Field Authorization (TFA 068408) for an additional 0.07 ha of clearing was obtained on August 17, 2006 for the affected lands.",Unresolved,Continue monitoring the re-establishment of ground cover.,A. SOIL CAPABILITY,,ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED DURING CONSTRUCTION
(b) degradation of soil structure and lowering of soil capability through compaction and rutting,Entire route,Stripping occasionally occurred in matted areas despite • the presence of soft ground beneath. Areas of standing water were not stripped. Rutting at log decks due to log haulers was regraded. •,Unresolved,Continue monitoring the re-establishment of ground cover.,A. SOIL CAPABILITY,,ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED DURING CONSTRUCTION
(c) trench subsidence and crowning,Entire route,No issues were noted in 2007. •,Unresolved,Continue monitoring for trench subsidence and for excessive crown loss causing altered drainage patterns.,A. SOIL CAPABILITY,,ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED DURING CONSTRUCTION
