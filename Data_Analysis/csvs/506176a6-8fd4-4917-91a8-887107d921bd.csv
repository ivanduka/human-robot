(a) loss of vegetation important to wildlife,Entire route,See Soil Capability and Wetlands element •,Resolved,See Wetlands element,5. VEGETATION,,
(b) loss of medicinal plants and/or berry bushes,Entire route,"Native vegetation was observed along the right-of-way in 2009 • and includes horsetail, fireweed, yarrow and common cattail.",Resolved,"Continue monitoring the establishment of native vegetation during routine Operations and Maintenance activities. Control trees and shrubs, if necessary, to facilitate pipeline surveillance, by mechanical rather than chemical means.",5. VEGETATION,,
(c) weed introduction and spread,Entire route,"Trace densities of dandelion were observed at KP 0.4, perennial • sow-thistle and narrow-leaved hawk's-beard were observed at trace densities at KP 2.5 and creeping (Canada) thistle, hemp-nettle and common plantain were observed at trace densities at KP 5.3. Scentless chamomile was not observed during the 2009 PCM.",Resolved,Continue to monitor for weed growth and introduction during routine Operations and Maintenance activities.,5. VEGETATION,,
