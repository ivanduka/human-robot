(a) Slope and fill stability,Entire route,See Soil and Soil Productivity element ?,Resolved,See Soil and Soil Productivity element,1. PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT,,
(a) Strippings / subsoil mixing,Entire route,Strippings were replaced over the stripped areas ? along the pipeline route. Vegetation establishment was not observed to be ? impacted by minor surface admixing in 2009.,Resolved,Continue to monitor the re-establishment of ground cover during routine Operations and Maintenance activities.,2. SOIL AND SOIL PRODUCTIVITY,,
(b) Soil erosion,Entire route,"Since the right-of-way was observed to be recently ? graded and recontoured, minimal vegetation was observed KP 1.5.",Unresolved,Continue to monitor the re-establishment of ground cover during routine Operations and Maintenance activities.,2. SOIL AND SOIL PRODUCTIVITY,,
(c) Trench subsidence,Entire route,Trench line subsidence occurs at KP 2.1. ?,Unresolved,Repair and continue to monitor for trench settlement during routine Operations and Maintenance activities.,2. SOIL AND SOIL PRODUCTIVITY,,
(a) Alterations of natural flow patterns,Entire route,All corduroy and geotextile matting along the ? right-of-way was removed post-construction in order to avoid interfering with natural drainage patterns and ensure adequate cross drainage across right-of-way. Slumping along drainage banks observed in 2009. ?,Unresolved,Stabilize drainage banks and continue to monitor for trench settlement during routine Operations and Maintenance activities.,3. WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY,,
(a) Loss or alteration of native vegetation and vegetation important to wildlife,Entire route,"Minimal clearing (approximately 5.2 ha) was required ? since the right-of-way parallels existing linear disturbances and previously disturbed lands. The abundance of low-growing shrubs and grasses ? has increased since the 2008 PCM. Since the right-of-way was observed to be recently ? graded and recontoured, minimal vegetation was observed KP 1.5.",Unresolved,Continue to monitor the re-establishment of low growing shrubs and grasses on the right-of-way during routine Operations and Maintenance activities.,4. VEGETATION,,
(a) Loss or alteration of potential wildlife habitat,Entire route,See Vegetation element ?,Resolved,See Vegetation element,5. WILDLIFE AND WILDLIFE HABITAT,,
