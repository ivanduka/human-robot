(a) slope/fill stability,Entire route and sidehill from KP 3.3 to KP 3.7,"The right-of-way was recontoured to restore the preconstruction • grades and drainage contours. Backfilling (shading) of the pipe and backfill were kept as close • as possible to lowering-in. Shading was closely monitored to ensure that no hard and/or • frozen clumps of dirt or rock were left on top the pipe which could cause indentations to the pipe upon completion of backfilling. Sidehill cuts were replaced and restored to their preconstruction • character to the extent practical. During the 2008 PCM, a recently constructed pipeline that • shared and crossed segments of the Mid-Tupper Pipelines right-of-way was noted near the EnCana compressor station in NE 31-74-13 W6M. The trench crown was observed to be recently reworked and • appears nearly level along the right-of-way from KP 0.5 to KP 0.9.",Unresolved,Continue monitoring for trench subsidence and for excessive crown loss causing altered drainage patterns and recontour where necessary.,1. PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT,,
(a) strippings/topsoil and subsoil mixing,Entire route,"Snow and duff remaining after grubbing, piling and burning was • windrowed along the spoil side from KP 0 to KP 0.6, split and windrowed to either side of the right-of-way from KP 0.6 to KP 2.5 and packed down along work side, pushed onto the work side where the 5 m of extra workspace was acquired from the landowners from KP 2.5 to KP 3.4 and ploughed to either side of the right-of-way and packed down on work side from KP 3.4 to KP 3.8. Topsoil was stored along the spoil side from KP 0 to KP 0.6. • From KP 0.6 to KP 3.8 topsoil was stored along the work side of the right-of-way. Topsoil was stripped from an area 4 m wide centred on the • trench line under frozen conditions. No issues were noted during the 2008 PCM. •",Resolved,N/A,2. SOIL CAPABILITY,,
(b) soil erosion,Entire route,"Agronomic and native seed mixes were applied along the • pipeline right-of-way as per the Environmental Alignment Sheets (TERA 2005) and landowner requests. Unseeded, tilled land was observed from KP 2.0 to KP 2.3 during • the 2008 PCM. Since the trench line was observed to be recently reworked from • KP 0.5 to KP 0.9, rollback and minimal vegetation was observed along trench line at this segment.",Unresolved,Continue monitoring vegetation establishment and soil erosion potential from KP 0.5 to KP 0.9 and from KP 2.0 to KP 2.3.,2. SOIL CAPABILITY,,
(c) compaction and rutting,Entire route and log decks at KP 0.5 and KP 1.9,"The right-of-way was dragged with a drag of tires in an effort to • freeze down the work side. Snow and duff were packed down with tires to build-up the work • side and provide a travel surface for construction from KP 0.6 to KP 2.5 and from KP 3.4 to KP 3.8. Compaction of the subsoil was relieved by deep cultivation with a • disc and then the surface was prepared for topsoil replacement by compacting the trench line, levelling the subsoil. No issues were noted during the 2008 PCM. •",Resolved,N/A,2. SOIL CAPABILITY,,
