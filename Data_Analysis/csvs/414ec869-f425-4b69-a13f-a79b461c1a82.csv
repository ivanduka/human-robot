Physical Environment,Topography,Not an issue due to level topography; there was sloping topography at ditches and water courses; ditches and water courses will be discussed in “Water Quality” section.,"No outstanding issues, however, farm fields should be monitored during the spring, after rain fall, to ensure effective surface runoff.",Improper surface grading.,Observed and re-assessed in spring 2014. Refer to table 1.2.,,,
Soil and Soil Productivity,Topsoil conservation,"On all farmland, the topsoil was removed from the entire width of the easement and stockpiled at the edge of the easement. Topsoil and subsoil were piled separately at all times, all locations. In non-farm fields topsoil was removed from the trench line area only and stockpiled at the edge of the easement, separate from the subsoil.",No outstanding issues.,Crop loss.,Compensation agreements have been finalized with farm operators.,,,
,Soil de-compaction,De-compaction was relieved by using a ripper. Subsoil across the entire RoW was ripped to a depth of 30 centimeters and leveled prior to topsoil replacement to prevent mixing of soil horizons. No vehicle traffic was permitted on topsoil once replaced. Topsoil was disked and ploughed to farm operator satisfaction during clean up.,No outstanding issues.,Crop loss,Compensation agreements have been finalized with farm operators.,,,
,Erosion,"N/A: due to the level topography and clayey texture of the soils in this area, wind and water erosion issues were not anticipated.",N/A,N/A,N/A,,,
,Artificial Agricultural Drainage,"Several artificial tile drains were encountered during trenching for the pipeline. Drains were flagged, repaired, inspected by the Environmental Inspector and photographed. Farm operators were provided with the opportunity to inspect and approve repairs prior to backfilling. No further issues with repaired drains are expected.",No outstanding issues.,N/A,N/A,,,
Vegetation,Removal,"Where necessary, vegetation was removed for the purpose of trenching. Where necessary, St. Clair Region Conservation Authority (SCRCA) and Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) permits were obtained prior to construction. Felled trees were replaced on a 2 for 1 basis and planted in locations approved by the SCRCA.",No outstanding issues.,"Reclaiming native vegetation, potential for invasive plant species and weeds.",Observed and reassessed in spring 2014. Refer to table 1.2.,,,
,Re-seeding/Re-planting,"The entire workspace, with exception to the farm fields, was re-seeded using standard Ministry of Transportation (MTO) mix, which consists of 55% Creeping Red Fescue, 27% Kentucky Bluegrass, 15% Perennial Ryegrass, 3% White Clover. Felled trees were replaced on a 2 for 1 basis and planted in locations approved by the SCRCA.",Some of the re-seeding efforts have not yet been successful. A second seed application has been applied.,Temporary vegetation loss and exposed soil susceptible to invasive plant species and weeds.,"Re-seeded areas were observed during the spring freshet. Where applicable, seed was applied during the spring of 2014 to establish pre-construction conditions. Refer to table 1.2.",,,
Water Quality  and Quantity,Watercourses,"Four watercourse crossings were completed by Horizontal Directional Drill (HDD) and one by open cut. The open cut crossing occurred through a municipal drain regulated by the SCRCA. As per the SCRCA permit, the open cut crossing was done in dry conditions. All crossings followed the Environmental Protection Plan and if regulated by the SCRCA, a permit was obtained and followed. Minor “frac out” occurred during the HDD of Marsh Creek (see Figure 1.1 for location). Crew deployed “frac out” procedures immediately. The drilling rig shut down and remediation materials located at the creek were used. Materials included straw bales, stakes and filter cloth. Straw bales were placed into the creek to prevent siltation downstream. Bales were removed when the water quality (suspended solids) returned to background levels.   atercourse crossing locations (UTM’s):

Wildlife and wildlife habitat,Killdeer,"Several nests were found in the workspace throughout the span of the project. Nest locations were communicated to crew members. Nests were staked to allow for a 5-10 m setback from work placements. Where possible, work was delayed until nests became inactive. The Environmental Inspector was on site during work around nests to assist crew with locating and avoiding nests.",No outstanding issues.,Harm and/or disturbance to wildlife.,,,,
