SE 35-79-14,Hay,Subsidence,"Poor vegetation establishment, weeds","2010: Subsidence at KP 1.6 is 10 m long and 20 cm deep along trench line. 2011: Subsidence at KP 1.6 is 10 m long and 20 cm deep along trench line. 2012: Areas of settled ditch line and poor vegetation. Monitor vegetation this summer and haul in topsoil to complete repairs. 2014: Poor vegetation establishment, 15 cm subsidence and increased weeds, including foxtail barley, Canada thistle and wild oats observed from KP 1.29 to KP 1.46.","2012: Disked right of way where vegetation was poor and planned to haul in topsoil to repair settled areas, however, early snowfall delayed plans until 2013. 2013: Re worked right of way with tractor and disc, hauled in topsoil to fill subsidence, re contoured drainage, prepared right of way for re seeding and seeded right of way. Germination was poor in some spots and good in others. Landowner sprayed for noxious/nuisance weeds. ARC monitored the right of way. 2014: Disced areas of poor vegetation and re seeded. Topsoil was hauled in to fill subsided tie in edges and the right of way was sprayed for noxious and nuisance weeds. 2015: Topsoil was distributed over the area.",Vegetation parameters were comparable on and off ROW. No weed issues were observed at the time of assessment. Subsidence was not observed and natural contours have been re established (Plate 1).,Resolved.,,,
SW 5-80-13,Cultivated,Subsidence,--,"2014: Subsidence observed at KP 6.28, 18 m x 5 m x 30 cm deep.",2014: Topsoil was hauled into the site in 2015 and spread in 2016.,Subsidence and erosion were not observed at the time of assessment (Plate 2). Natural drainage patterns have been re established.,Resolved.,,,
SE 8-80-13,Cultivated,"Subsidence, erosion",--,"2010: Subsidence at KP 7.5 is 30 m long and 10 cm deep along trench line. Subsidence at KP 8.1 is 15 m long and 15 cm deep along trench line. 2011: No subsidence observed. Rill erosion observed on right of way at KP 7.5 to KP 7.6 and KP 8.2. 2012: Some erosion damage due to heavy rains last summer. The berm between the municipal road ditch and the field will be repaired in May 2012 to prevent runoff from the road ditch into the field. Haul in topsoil to repair erosion. 2014: The ditch at the field edge at KP 7.38 is not high enough and is resulting in some gully erosion as water travels over the ditch edge. The height of the ditch needs to be increased to assist in reducing erosion issues. Weeds, including Canada thistle, are present in this area. Natural drainage is located at KP 7.56, 40 cm wide x 15 m long x 8 cm deep on the right of way. Drainages similar to this were also observed off the right of way across the field and this is, therefore, not considered an issue. Subsidence 80 m long x 25 cm wide x 4 cm deep observed over trench line at KP 8.17. This depression extends into the field to the north and terminates at a wetland.","2012: Hauled in clay fill, built up berm between municipal road and field edge. Hauled in topsoil to fill the erosion rills caused by run off. 2014: Hauled in clay fill and built up berm between municipal road and field edge. Planned to haul in topsoil to fill subsidence, however, landowner was unable to harvest the canola swaths due to wet weather conditions. ARC built up the berm on the north side of the municipal road and dug out the ditch to channelize runoff.",Berm along municipal road is intact and the ditch is sufficiently deep to channelize road runoff (Plate 3). Subsidence has been ameliorated by the tilling of the field during cultivation and further erosion and subsidence were not observed.,Resolved.,,,
NE 8-80-13,Hay,"Erosion, subsidence",--,"2012: Areas of settled ditch line and rill erosion unresolved. Haul in topsoil to repair. 2014: A trench is present at the field line, which was filled in during pipeline construction. This trench is causing runoff into the field resulting in rill erosion. A subsidence issue 10 m long x 40 cm wide x 30 cm deep was also observed at KP 8.26. Weeds, including Canada thistle and wild oats, were observed in the field line in this area, however, weed densities are similar off right of way and, therefore, this is not considered a weed issue.","2014: ARC re contoured the drainage that runs between the NE and SE section, filled the erosion rill with topsoil and re contoured the low areas for better drainage.",No erosion or subsidence was observed at the time of assessment (Plate 4).,Resolved.,,,
NW 16-80-13,Cultivated,Subsidence,--,2010: Subsidence at KP 10.7 is 5 m long and 20 cm deep along trench line. 2011: No land access granted at time of survey. 2012: Areas of settled ditch line. Haul in topsoil to repair. 2014: Subsidence 6 m long x 50 cm wide x 8 cm deep observed at KP 10.55.,2012: Hauled in topsoil and filled the subsided areas on the right of way at KP 10.7. Monitored vegetation growth. 2014: Topsoil was spread over the subsided area in 2015,Subsidence was not observed at KP 10.55 at the time of assessment (Plate 5).,Resolved.,,,
NE 16-80-13,Cultivated,Subsidence,--,"2010: Subsidence up to 40 cm deep at KP 11.3. 2011: No land access granted at time of survey. 2012: Some erosion, settled ditch line and admixing unresolved. Haul in topsoil to repair. 2014: Subsidence 19 m long x 90 cm wide x 5 cm deep observed at KP 10.80. Subsidence 10 m long x 2 m wide and 9 cm deep observed at KP 11.45 (at the location where the pipe bends).","2012: Hauled in topsoil to amend the admixed soils, filled the erosion rills and subsided ditchline. Topsoil was imported in and spread over the subsided bell holes at KP 10.8 and KP 11.45.",Subsidence was not observed at KP 10.80 or KP 11.45 at the time of assessment (Plates 6 and 7).,Resolved.,,,
NW 15?80?13,Cultivated,Subsidence,Reduced crop height,"2010: Subsidence at KP 11.6 is 15 m long and 10 cm deep along trench line. 2011: No land access granted at time of survey. 2012: No comments. 2014: Shovel tests conducted at various points along the right of way indicate soil consistency and admixing to be equal on and off the right of way. Crop had been harvested prior to assessment so crop heights could not be compared, however, density and health of stubble appeared the same on and off the right of way. No subsidence issues observed. A 5 10 cm high pile of soil was observed from KP 12.04 to KP 12.23. This was identified as additional replacement topsoil that was not spread in fall 2014. Issue is not causing any drainage concerns.",2012: Hauled in topsoil to fill the subsided ditchline at several locations within the NW 15. Did not spread last load of topsoil as weather became too wet. Monitored vegetation growth: vegetation increased in height and density due to climatic conditions (freeze & thaw) and good farming practices. 2014: topsoil pile between KP 12.04 and KP 12.23 was spread and blended into the soil on the right of way.,Crop height was comparable on and off ROW and subsidence was not observed (Plate 8).,Resolved.,,,
