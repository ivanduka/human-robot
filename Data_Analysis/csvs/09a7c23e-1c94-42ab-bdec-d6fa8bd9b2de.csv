Revegetation,SBindloss  20+000 to 20+420 SW-21-21-1-W41SE-20-21-1-W4 ite #7 on Figure 2,,,,,,,"• Land occupant (grazing lease holder) contacted Keystone with concern related to the amount of Prairie Sandreed grass growing and not being as palatable for grazing when his cattle are utilizing the area. Keystone rep met with the occupant and Special Areas Board rep in August 2016 to review concerns, discuss options and agree on a plan forward.   • To encourage competition for other native grasses, Keystone mowed the Prairie Sandreed grass in late-August, and overseeded/ harrowed areas having lower vegetation cover around the valve site with Awned Wheatgrass in October 2016.  • Monitor in 2017",• Results of the 2017 assessment indicated that the Awned Wheatgrass seeded in 2016 was not successful. The assessment also noted that there was no observable increase in Prairie Sandreed grass. This location and related information will be transferred to Keystone Regional Operations for continued engagement with the Occupant and Special Areas Board members and to create a path forward if there are continued concerns regarding the site.  •  Issue resolved.,,,
