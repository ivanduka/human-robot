b) Weed proliferation,KP 177.97; KP 178.21 to KP 178.22; and KP 182.3,"- Leafy spurge present on construction right-of-way at KP 177.97 and KP 178.21 to KP 178.22. The plants, their root systems and the affected soil were excavated, loaded into trucks and transported to the Hardisty soil remediation site where oil contaminated soils are incinerated. - Plants were removed where found during the 2002 post-construction monitoring program. - A patch of 100-200 plants found and removed at KP 177.97. No leafy spurge found from KP 178.21 to KP 178.22 or at KP 182.3. - A small patch (approx. 5 m x 5 m) was found on the south side of the right-of-way at KP 177.97. Enbridge will spray the patch and then reseed.",Resolved,- O&M to monitor in 2005,1. LOSS OF AGRICULTURAL CAPABILITY,,
b) Weed proliferation,KP 234.7,"- Topsoil from a 20 m x 30 m area infested with yellow toadflax was salvaged and stockpiled separately from adjacent topsoils. During clean-up the topsoil was replaced over its preconstruction location. Equipment involved in topsoil salvage and replacement activities were cleaned prior to proceeding down the right-of-way. - Large patch (1,000’s of plants) found on and off of the right-of-way at this location during the 2002 post-construction monitoring program. - No yellow toadflax identifiable, but pasture heavily overgrazed. - Toadflax seen on and off the right-of-way, but area is heavily grazed and toadflax is also being grazed.",Resolved,- O&M to monitor in 2005. Landowner to be notified of off right-of-way patch.,1. LOSS OF AGRICULTURAL CAPABILITY,,
a) Loss of rare plants,KP 177.75 to KP 177.79,"- In order to protect sand millet, the work side was narrowed by ~5 m, no grading was allowed and a blade width of sod was salvaged and placed on straw matting. The sod was then replaced and straw from the matting was then spread over the replaced sod. Low milkweed at KP 177.7 were transplanted prior to commencement of construction. - No sand millet was located during the 2002 post-construction monitoring program. Sod pieces were not rooted well. - No sand millet found. Pasture had been grazed. - Approximately 3,000 plants were found.",Resolved,---,5. VEGETATION,,
a) Loss of rare plants  (cont’d),KP 272.85 to KP 272.9,"- The work side was narrowed by ~10 m, no grading was allowed and swamp mats were placed on the work side in order to protect little bluestem. Sod salvage was not feasible due to hummocky terrain. Straw was spread on the spoil side prior to trenching to avoid scalping of the sod layer during backfill. - Conditions were very dry, but hummocky community appears to have retained its diversity. No plants were found during the 2002 post-construction monitoring program. - Hot and dry conditions. No rare plants found during the 2003 monitoring program. - Hummocky community found but area had been recently grazed and no little bluestem found.",Resolved,---,5. VEGETATION,,
a) Loss of rare plants  (cont’d),KP 273.1,- A backhoe was used to transplant sod in a 1 m radius of a Louisiana broom-rape site. - No rare plants were found during the 2002 post-construction monitoring program. - Hot and dry conditions. No rare plants found during the 2003 monitoring program. - Cattle grazing at this location during the 2004 monitoring program. No rare plants found.,Resolved,---,5. VEGETATION,,
a) Loss of rare plants  (cont’d),KP 324.76 to KP 324.84,- Stripping depth and width were minimized; and no grading was allowed in order to minimize impacts on awned or mountain mousetail and least mousetail. - Very dry conditions. No rare plants were found during the 2002 post-construction monitoring program.  - Hot and dry conditions. No rare plants found during the 2003 monitoring program. - No rare plants found at this location.,Resolved,---,5. VEGETATION,,
a) Loss of rare plants  (cont’d),KP 326.33 to KP 326.35; KP 326.67 to KP 326.93 KP 326.97 to KP 327.50,"- Stripping depth and width were minimized; and no grading was allowed in order to minimize impacts on narrow-leaved plantain and few-flowered aster. - One dead narrow-leaved plantain was found in fruit, but no few-flowered aster were found during the 2002 post-construction monitoring program.  - Hot and dry conditions. No rare plants found during the 2003 monitoring program. - Approximately 150-200 few-flowered aster plants were found at KP 326.6.",Resolved,---,5. VEGETATION,,
a) Loss of rare plants  (cont’d),KP 330.0 to KP 330.38; KP 330.7 to KP 330.85,"- Stripping depth and width were minimized; and no grading was allowed to minimize impacts on narrow-leaved plantain, awned or mountain mousetail, or least mousetail. - Very dry conditions. No rare plants located during the 2002 post-construction monitoring program.  - Hot and dry conditions. No rare plants found during the 2003 monitoring program. - No rare plants found during the 2004 monitoring program.",Resolved,---,5. VEGETATION,,
a) Loss of rare plants  (cont’d),KP 330.85 to KP 331.25,"- Upper leaf litter and duff/soil (1 cm) were salvaged separately from lower topsoil to preserve seed bank containing awned or mountain mousetail, least mousetail and narrow-leaved plantain. - Very dry conditions. No rare plants located during the 2002 post-construction monitoring program.  - Hot and dry conditions. No rare plants found during the 2003 monitoring program.  - One narrow-leaved plantain was found at KP 331.25.",Resolved,---,5. VEGETATION,,
a) Loss of rare plants  (cont’d),KP 331.26 to KP 331.3,"- In order to minimize impacts on heart-leaved buttercup, equipment travel was minimized, no grading was approved without the approval of the Environmental Inspector and a blade width of sod was salvaged from the trench area, stored on a straw mat and then replaced. - Very dry conditions. No rare plants located during the 2002 post-construction monitoring program.  - Hot and dry conditions. No rare plants found during the 2003 monitoring program. - 75 plants found in fruit on the south side of the right-of-way.",Resolved,---,5. VEGETATION,,
b) Monitor regrowth of pasture,KP 198.6 to KP 199.6,- Sparse growth noted from 2004 overflight. - O&M crews will overseed in the fall (see Section 3.2.2).,Resolved,- O&M to monitor in 2005,5. VEGETATION,,
