Temporary bridges and swamp mats,"Where access was not available on either side of a watercourse or wetland, temporary bridges and swamp mats were used for crossing.","ASAll temporary bridges and swamp mats were removed. ll approaches straw mulched to prevent bank erosion.  tream banks, bridge approaches, and access trails were monitored to ensure stabilization and erosion control measures implemented were successful.",None ,(Resolved see photos Appendix B of Year Two Post-Construction Report),,,
Corduroy,Corduroy was used to access structures located in wetlands.,"CWThe wood and geo-grid was removed, recycled and utilized by Brunswick Pipeline for use as rip-rap underlay.  Most of the corduroy along the right-of-way was removed in 2008.  In some cases it was determined that corduroy removal would be more detrimental than to leave in. orduroy between structures 148 to 150 was removed and access trail was mulched and seeded.  etland field surveys were conducted in 2010.  The results are provided in Appendix C",None  ,Resolved,,,
Site stabilization,Disturbed areas where activities were undertaken,"TA number of areas (i.e. along the right-of-way, access trails and roads, and around wetlands) were mulched and seeded. he success of stabilization and erosion control measures was monitored on slopes at various locations along the right-of-way",None ,(Resolved see photos Appendix B of Year Two Post-Construction Report),,,
Structure locations,Work area around the structure locations,Work areas were seeded and straw mulched including structures 160 and 162. Grounding sites were monitored and no issues were identified.,None ,Resolved,,,
Brunswick Pipeline shared right-of-way,The newly constructed Brunswick Pipeline parallels and shares the IPL right-of-way for a considerable distance.,"WAlthough Brunswick Pipeline has implemented measures during construction to mitigate impacts, a number of locations on the IPL right-of-way have been impacted by pipeline activities (e.g. temporary work room, spoil piles, corduroy, rock rip-rap, etc).  orked closely with representatives of Brunswick Pipeline to address issues and concerns noted on the Environmental Issues List.",None ,(Resolved  see photos Appendix B of Year Two Post-Construction Report),,,
