(a) slope/fill stability,Entire route and sidehill from KP 3.3 to KP 3.7,"The right-of-way was recontoured to restore the preconstruction • grades and drainage contours. Backfilling (shading) of the pipe and backfill were kept as close • as possible to lowering-in. Shading was closely monitored to ensure that no hard and or • frozen clumps of dirt or rock were left on top the pipe which could cause indentations to the pipe upon completion of backfilling. Sidehill cuts were replaced and restored to their preconstruction • character to the extent practical. During the 2008 PCM, a recently constructed pipeline that • shared and crossed segments of the Mid-Tupper Pipelines right-of-way was noted near the EnCana compressor station in NE 31-74-13 W6M. The trench crown was observed to be recently reworked and • appears nearly level along the right-of-way from KP 0.5 to KP 0.9.",Unresolved,Continue monitoring for trench subsidence and for excessive crown loss causing altered drainage patterns and recontour where necessary.,1. PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT,,
(a) strippings/topsoil and subsoil mixing,Entire route,"Snow and duff remaining after grubbing, piling and burning was • windrowed along the spoil side from KP 0 to KP 0.6, split and windrowed to either side of the right-of-way from KP 0.6 to KP 2.5 and packed down along work side, pushed onto the work side where the 5 m of extra workspace was acquired from the landowners from KP 2.5 to KP 3.4 and ploughed to either side of the right-of-way and packed down on work side from KP 3.4 to KP 3.8. Topsoil was stored along the spoil side from KP 0 to KP 0.6. • From KP 0.6 to KP 3.8 topsoil was stored along the work side of the right-of-way. Topsoil was stripped from an area 4 m wide centred on the • trench line under frozen conditions. No issues were noted during the 2008 PCM. •",Resolved,N/A,2. SOIL CAPABILITY,,
(b) soil erosion,Entire route,"Agronomic and native seed mixes were applied along the • pipeline right-of-way as per the Environmental Alignment Sheets (TERA 2005) and landowner requests. Unseeded, tilled land was observed from KP 2.0 to KP 2.3 during • the 2008 PCM. Since the trench line was observed to be recently reworked from • KP 0.5 to KP 0.9, rollback and minimal vegetation was observed along trench line at this segment.",Unresolved,Continue monitoring vegetation establishment and soil erosion potential from KP 0.5 to KP 0.9 and from KP 2.0 to KP 2.3.,2. SOIL CAPABILITY,,
(c) compaction and rutting,Entire route and log decks at KP 0.5 and KP 1.9,"The right-of-way was dragged with a drag of tires in an effort to • freeze down the work side. Snow and duff were packed down with tires to build-up the work • side and provide a travel surface for construction from KP 0.6 to KP 2.5 and from KP 3.4 to KP 3.8. Compaction of the subsoil was relieved by deep cultivation with a • disc and then the surface was prepared for topsoil replacement by compacting the trench line, levelling the subsoil. No issues were noted during the 2008 PCM. •",Resolved,N/A,2. SOIL CAPABILITY,,

(a) alteration of natural flow patterns,Entire route,See Physical Environment element •,--,See Physical Environment element,3. WATER QUANTITY AND QUALITY,,
(a) loss of wetland habitat,Entire route,"Construction occurred during frozen ground conditions. • The right-of-way was recontoured to restore the preconstruction • grades and drainage contours. The topographical and hydrological conditions of the wetlands • were restored. During the 2008 PCM, low-lying areas along the right-of-way • were observed to be consistent with preconstruction drainage contours.  Since the trench line was observed to be recently reworked from • KP 0.5 to KP 0.9, rollback and minimal vegetation was observed along trench line at this segment. Recovery appears moderately successful along wet areas at • KP 1.7 and KP 2.4.",Unresolved,"Continue monitoring the re-establishment of ground cover, soil erosion potential and weed growth from KP 0.5 to KP 0.9, at KP 1.7 and KP 2.4.",4. WETLANDS,,
(a) loss or alteration of vegetation important to wildlife,Entire route,"Minimal clearing (approximately 6.56 ha) was required since the • right-of-way encountered previously disturbed land in Alberta. Agronomic and native seed mixes were applied along the • pipeline right-of-way as per the Environmental Alignment Sheets (TERA 2005) and landowner requests. Few areas of poor growth were noted during the 2008 PCM and • vegetation establishment generally appears successful along the right-of-way. Since the trench line was observed to be recently reworked from • KP 0.5 to KP 0.9, rollback and minimal vegetation was observed along trench line at this segment. Revegetation appears moderately successful along muskeg • areas at KP 1.7 and KP 2.4.",Unresolved,"Continue monitoring the re-establishment of ground cover, soil erosion potential and weed growth from KP 0.5 to KP 0.9, at KP 1.7 and KP 2.4.",5. VEGETATION,,
(b) weed introduction and spread,Entire route,"Two pieces of equipment arrived dirty and had to be cleaned • prior to being allowed on the project. A wash truck was brought in to complete this work. Construction occurred during frozen ground conditions. • The right-of-way was dragged with a drag of tires in an effort to • freeze down the work side. Equipment was parked next to the road on the Devon Lease at • 11-31-74-13 W6M and washed down with a steam truck. The soil and water that came off the machinery while it was being cleaned up was contained to be sprayed at the same time the right-of-way was sprayed for weeds during final clean-up. Scentless chamomile plants were observed at KP 0.9 and • KP 1.3 during the 2008 PCM. Dandelion, flixweed, narrow-leaved hawk's-beard, shepherd's-• purse, stinkweed, pineapple weed, wild oats and hemp-nettle were observed along unseeded land from KP 2.0 to KP 2.3.",Unresolved,Hand pull scentless chamomile at KP 0.9 and KP 1.3. Continue monitoring right-of-way for weed problem areas.,5. VEGETATION,,

(a) disruption of farming activities,Entire route,"Landowners were notified in advance of the route, site locations • and construction schedule. All fences that were removed during construction were replaced • to landowner satisfaction. Crop height, density and vigour appeared consistent with off • right-of-way crop conditions. Unseeded, tilled land was observed from KP 2.0 to KP 2.3 during • the 2008 PCM.",Unresolved,Assess crop characteristics from KP 2.0 to KP 2.3.,7. HUMAN OCCUPANCY AND RESOURCE USE,,
