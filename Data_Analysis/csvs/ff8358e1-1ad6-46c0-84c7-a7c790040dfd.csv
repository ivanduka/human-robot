(a) reduction of water quality,"Pipeline crossing of small drainages (KP 2.5, KP 5.0 and KP 5.5)","Temporary silt fences were erected near approaches • at all drainage crossings, prior to initiating crossings. Temporary bridge matting was installed for the small • drainages at KP 2.5 and KP 5.5, and was removed post-construction. Silt fencing repaired as of September 2007 (Beatty • pers. comm.).",Resolved,,1. FISH AND FISH HABITAT,,
(b) alteration of instream and riparian habitat,"Pipeline crossing of small drainages (KP 2.5, KP 5.0 and KP 5.5)","Coconut cloth was installed after construction to • protect banks from erosion at the small drainage at KP 5.5. Approach slopes of the small drainage at KP 2.5 were • seeded, while banks and slopes of the small drainages at KP 5.0 and KP 5.5 did not appear to be seeded. The disturbed areas of the bed and banks of the small • drainages at KP 5.0 and KP 5.5 were restored to preconstruction profile.",Resolved,Continue to monitor for vegetation re-establishment along low-lying wet areas and drainage crossings during normal Operations and Maintenance activities.,1. FISH AND FISH HABITAT,,
(a) loss or alteration of vegetation important to wildlife,Entire route,Minimal clearing (approximately 9 ha) was required as • the right-of-way paralleled existing clearing for 95% of its route. Natural recovery occurring along the length of the • right-of-way in Alberta and in BC. Few low-growing shrubs and grasses were observed • along the right-of-way at the time of the PCM program.,Resolved,Continue to monitor the re-establishment of low-growing shrubs and grasses on the right-of-way during normal Operations and Maintenance activities.,2.  VEGETATION,,
(b) weed introduction and spread,Entire route,No weeds of concern were identified during the • post-construction monitoring program.,Resolved,"Narrow-leaved hawk's-beard, alsike clover, dandelion and quack grass were observed at low densities along the right-of-way.  Continue to monitor for weed growth and introduction during normal Operations and Maintenance activities.",2.  VEGETATION,,
(a) loss or alteration of potential wildlife habitat,Entire route,Minimal clearing (approximately (9 ha) was required as • the right-of-way paralleled existing clearing for 95% of its route. Natural recovery occurring along the length of the • right-of-way in Alberta and in BC. Few low-growing shrubs and grasses were observed • along the right-of-way at the time of the PCM program.,Resolved,Continue to monitor the re-establishment of low-growing shrubs and grasses on the right-of-way during normal Operations and Maintenance activities.,3.   WILDLIFE AND WILDLIFE HABITAT,,
(a) strippings/subsoil mixing,Entire route,"Strippings were windrowed along the spoil side of the • right-of-way with openings left at watercourses, game trails, and where sidehills were encountered. Trenching activities during wet conditions resulted in • the spoil pile slumping off the right-of-way by approximately 1 m. A Temporary Field Authorization (TFA) (068408) for an additional 0.07 ha of clearing was obtained on August 17, 2006 for the affected lands. Surface admixing was observed at KP 2.6 during the • 2007 PCM, however, the extent and severity of the observed surface admixing were not assessed due to limited re-vegetation success along the entire route.",Resolved,"Profile admixing was observed at KP 2.6 and KP 5.9 during the 2008 PCM. Continue monitoring the re-establishment of ground cover, soil erosion potential and weed growth during normal Operations and Maintenance activities. Rototill and spread additional mulch or wood chips or seed landowner approved cover crop to encourage surface water retention, increase soil moisture and facilitate seed establishment, if warranted.",A.  SOIL CAPABILITY,,ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED DURING CONSTRUCTION
(b) degradation of soil structure and lowering of soil capability through compaction and rutting,Entire route,Stripping occasionally occurred in matted areas • despite the presence of soft ground beneath. Areas of standing water were not stripped. Rutting at log decks due to log haulers was regraded. •,Resolved,Continue monitoring the re-establishment of ground cover during normal Operations and Maintenance activities.,A.  SOIL CAPABILITY,,ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED DURING CONSTRUCTION
(c) trench subsidence and crowning,Entire route,No issues were noted in 2007. •,Resolved,Continue to monitor for trench settlement during normal Operations and Maintenance activities.,A.  SOIL CAPABILITY,,ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED DURING CONSTRUCTION
