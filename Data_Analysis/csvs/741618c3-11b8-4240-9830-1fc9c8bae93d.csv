KP 0.000 to KP 0.240,Forested,No issues observed,Vegetative cover is established through this section and no other concerns were noted.,No action required,Resolved,,,
KP 0.240 to KP 0.320,Forested,Vegetation,Vegetative cover was not at standard on the right-of-way (ROW) or in the temporary work space (TWS) at this location.,"Harrow, seed and fertilize (Photo 1 in Section 5.2)",Resolved,,,
KP 0.320 to KP 1.775,Forested,No issues,"There is subsidence along a third party pipeline and at the pipeline crossing at KP 0.035 (not Westcoast related) Armoring, bed and banks are stable on the two unnamed tributaries to Mackie Creek at KP 1.010 and KP 1.130, and the riparian zones are vegetated.",No action required other than notifying third party pipeline owner of subsidence concerns .,Resolved,,,
KP 1.775 to KP 1.925,Forested,Vegetation,There were several patches along the sidehill where vegetative cover was less than required.,"Hand rake, seed and fertilize",Resolved,,,
KP 1.925 to KP 2.570,Forested,No issues observed,Vegetative cover is well established throughout this section and no other concerns were noted.,No action required,Resolved,,,
KP 2.570,Forested,Subsidence,Minor subsidence over the bellhole above the road ditch on the landowner gravel pit road.,"Fill, pack, seed and fertilize minor area of subsidence (Photo 2 in Section 5.2)",Resolved,,,
KP 2.570 to KP 3.602,Forested,No issues observed,"Armoring, bed and banks are stable on Mackie Creek at  KP 3.320 (where disturbance took place) and the riparian zone is well vegetated.  Survival of the planted stock (e.g. willow  and spruce) is low due to the extensive vegetative cover and associated competition.",No action required,Resolved,,,
KP 3.602 to KP 4.050,Hay,Soil Management / Vegetation,The landowner was responsible for seeding.  Seeding did not occur and as a result there has been minor rill erosion and volunteer vegetative growth.  Coverage is adequate although  not the preferred species for the landowner.  As a result the landowner plans to cultivate and seed in the coming year.,No action required,Resolved,,,
KP 4.050 to KP 4.070,Road Allowance,Erosion,Adjacent pipeline cleanup and landowner activity did not tie  surface flows into the established drainage across the ROW causing erosion channeling adjacent to the drainage.,"Repair erosion gullies, reshape and armor drainage, install  topsoil adjacent to the drainage, install erosion control matting, in the drainage, seed and fertilize (Photo 3 in Section 5.2)",Resolved,,,
KP 4.070 to KP 5.300,Pasture/ Forested,Erosion,Landowner seeding was completed and has established.  The drainage / wet site between KP 4.646 and KP 4.749 has stabilized and is well vegetated. There were three locations across this quarter with rill or minor gully erosion on the ROW.  Although the landowner was not concerned the sites were repaired to avoid further issues.,"Repair erosion, seed and fertilize",Resolved,,,
KP 5.300 to KP 7.350,Pasture/ Forested,No issues observed,Vegetative cover is well established throughout this section and no other concerns were noted.,No action required,Resolved,,,
KP 7.350 TO KP 7.730,Lynx Creek,No issues observed,"Armoring, bed, flood channel and banks are stable on Lynx Creek at KP 7.520.  The riparian zone is well vegetated and  the surface breakers are stable and functioning as required.  Survival of the planted stock (e.g. willow and spruce, etc.) is adequate considering the extensive vegetative cover.",No action required,Resolved,,,
KP 7.730 to KP 8.150,Forested,Vegetation,The new landowner has decided to hay the ROW through this previously forested area.  Vegetation establishment is progressing well however less than optimal for the production  of hay.  The landowner requested further work be completed  to enhance vegetative cover.  It should also be noted that due to the cutting of hay all planted tree stock above the break in slope south of Lynx Creek has now been removed.,Over seed with a pasture mix (as per specific landowner request) and fertilize.  Also landowner caused rutting was corrected above the break in slope at Lynx Creek to eliminate water channeling and the potential for erosion (Photo 4 in Section 5.2).,Resolved,,,
KP 8.150 to KP 8.230,Watercourse,No issues observed,"Surface breakers, bed and banks are stable on the unnamed tributary to Lynx Creek at KP 8.190.  The riparian zone is vegetated.  Beavers continue to install damns downstream of the ROW causing standing water on a portion of the ROW at times.",No action required,Resolved,,,
KP 8.230 to KP 9.050,Cultivated,No issues observed,This land is currently being used for pasture and hay production.  Vegetative cover is well established throughout this section and no other concerns were noted.,No action required,Resolved,,,
KP 9.050 to KP 9.150,Cultivated,Vegetation,"Livestock herding adjacent to the gates and road on both the north and south sides of the road has caused soil compaction, minor water ponding and lack of vegetative cover.","Re-establish and improve grade, install topsoil, track pack and seed (Photos 5 and 6 in Section 5.2).",Resolved,,,
KP 9.150 to KP 12.310,Cultivated / Pasture,No issues observed,This land is currently being used for pasture and hay production.  Vegetative cover is well established and no other concerns were observed on this ranch.,No action required,Resolved,,,
KP 12.310 to KP 12.690,Pasture,No issues observed,This land is currently being used for pasture.  Vegetative cover is established and no other concerns were noted.,No action required,Resolved,,,
KP 12.690 to KP 12.775,Riparian Zone,Compaction / Vegetation,"The adjacent rancher (with the landowner’s permission) fenced the ROW down the north slope of Brenot Creek to the water.  Five hundred yearling heifers were then allowed to graze the area and access the creek for water for over a month in the spring.  The extensive vegetation on this sensitive site was grazed to the roots, one surface breaker was damaged and surface depressions were caused in two other locations on the lower slope.  Significant compaction was caused on the entire slope.","Install topsoil at the damaged surface breaker and in the two surface depressions, pack topsoil, seed and rake (Photo 7 in Section 5.2).  Remove displaced erosion control mat from the other surface breakers (to minimize more of it getting torn up). Over-seed the entire north slope riparian zone with a pasture mix.  Note that no effort was made to de-compact soils as the landowner and rancher plan to use the area again in the spring for cattle (currently there are a small herd of horses).  Further surface disturbance at this time would provide the opportunity for considerably more damage or slope instability if this land use practice continues.",Resolved,,,
KP 12.775 to KP 13.110,Forested / Pasture,No issues observed,"Armoring, bed and banks are stable on Brenot Creek at KP 12.780.  The riparian zone is well vegetated (on the south slope) and the surface breakers are stable and functioning as required.  Survival of the planted stock (e.g. willow and spruce, etc.) has suffered considerable livestock damage and competition from extensive vegetative cover.  The fence at the top of the bank is down due to a buffalo herd breakout.  Vegetative cover is well established and no other concerns were noted on the property.",No action required,Resolved,,,
KP 13.110 to KP 13.920,Cultivated,No issues observed,Crop density and vigor as well as plant color was very good across this quarter. No other concerns were noted.,No action required,Complete,,,
KP 13.920 to KP 14.850,Pasture / Forested,Compaction / Vegetation,Intensive livestock use has caused considerable compaction and notable lack of vegetation through much of this area.  The landowner has not seeded as committed.  The exception is the coulee which is stable and well vegetated (the coulee had been re-seeded by the contractor during clean-up).,"We worked with the landowner to resolve this issue.  The landowner was responsive and disked the entire area that had been impacted by livestock including the ROW (Photo 8 in Section 5.2).  We then supplied the landowner with an appropriate pasture seed mix and fertilizer, and the landowner seeded and fertilized (as well as moved a cattle feeder and waterer off of the ROW).  The landowner had very poor success with seeding several areas on his property and had many questions and was very appreciative of the suggestions and provision of appropriate quality seed and direction for the ROW.",Resolved,,,
KP 14.850 to KP 16.340,Forested / Pasture,No issues observed,Crop density and vigor as well as plant color (on all newly cultivated areas) was very good across the remainder of this property. No other concerns were noted.,No action required,Resolved,,,
KP 16.340 to KP 17.895,Forested / Cultivated,No issues observed,The entire area is now under cultivation.  Crop density and vigor were good (considering the transition from forest land).    The landowner did ask us to fill in around two posts just off and to the side of the ROW.,"Added topsoil, packed and seeded minor subsidence at two locations just west of the T-North 2012Project ROW as per the landowners request (Photo 9 in Section 5.2).   Otherwise, no action required.",Resolved,,,
KP 17.895 to KP 17.950,Forested,Erosion,The bed and banks are stable on Portage Creek at KP 17.960.  The riparian zone is vegetated and the surface breakers are stable and functioning as required.  The planted willows are doing well although the landowner has been removing them to avoid interference with landowner’s horses.  Minor rutting on the upper slope (caused by third party workers) between the access road and the surface breaker had resulted in the development of several erosion gullies.,"Shape up and compact the erosion gullies.  Fill the erosion gullies with shale material and compact (Photo 10 in Section 5.2).  Apply topsoil over the disturbed area, seed and track pack  (Photo 11 in Section 5.2).",Resolved,,,
KP 17.950 to KP 18.510,Cultivated,No issues observed,The entire area is now under cultivation.  Crop density and vigor as well as plant color was very good and no other concerns  were noted.,No action required,Resolved,,,
KP 18.510 to 18.660,Forested,Erosion / Vegetation,The landowner had not seeded as committed.  As a result vegetation establishment was poor (well below the required standard) and rill and minor gully erosion was present.,"We worked with the landowner who disked and levelled the ROW to the top of the bank.  We then completed seeding (a pasture mix), fertilizer application and harrowing (Photo 12 in Section 5.2).",Resolved,,,
KP 18.660 to KP 18.770,Forested,No issues observed,"The armoring, bed and banks are stable on the tributary to Portage Creek at KP 18.680.  The riparian zone is very well vegetated and the surface breakers are stable and functioning as required.  The planted willows are also doing well.   No other concerns were noted.",No action required,Resolved,,,
KP 18.770 to KP 20.500,Forested,No issues,"Vegetative cover is well established throughout this section and no other concerns were observed.  However, it should be noted that third party and recreational vehicle users have created a trail along the west boundary of the ROW.  This vehicle trail likely replaces the trail that had been present prior to construction.  The trail has resulted in minimal impacts with the exception of vegetation loss in the tire tracks and minor rutting beside the one wetland (no potential for erosion or sediment transport at this location).",No action required,Resolved,,,
KP 20.500 to KP 21.900,Forested,Vegetation,"Vegetation establishment has been slowed somewhat by the drier sandy soils and impacts of recreational use (rutting and soil disturbances in the sandy soils).  However, overall vegetation establishment is within acceptable standards with isolated areas requiring enhancement to speed or improve the process.",Over-seed the entire area from KP 20.500 to KP 21.900 with a pasture / forestry / nurse crop seed and fertilizer mix to provide a greater variety of species to take advantage of specific micro-sites  and a nutrient boost to assist with further establishment and growth.,Resolved,,,
KP 21.900 to KP 24.000,Forested,No issues observed,"Vegetative cover has established well throughout this section, most growth is relatively well established and vigorous given the nature of the soils, and no other concerns were noted with the exception of several incidents of third party or recreation use impacts.",No action required,Resolved,,,
KP 24.000 to KP 24.300,Forested,Erosion,Vegetative cover has established well throughout this section and again most growth is vigorous given the nature of the soils.  There was one surface breaker at approximately KP 24.100 that had eroded creating a steep face and deeper than required channel.,"Repair the surface breaker at KP 24.100.  Round the steep downslope face to eliminate the unnecessarily high bank and use this material to fill in the deeper than required channel.  Pack, seed and fertilize (erosion control mat is not required in this cobble soil).",Resolved,,,
