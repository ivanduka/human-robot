Compaction,Entire route,"-  Construction was typically suspended during wet soil conditions.   -  Wet subsoils were not ripped prior to topsoil replacement. -  Penetrometer measurements indicated that compaction was not evident as a result of const-ruction.  Nevertheless, some residual compaction may remain at locations where penetrometer measurements were not taken. -  Compaction was tested in all areas with visible crop growth problems during summer 2000 post-construction monitoring.  No compaction differences were found between on and off right-of-way tests at these sites, except from KP 669.2 to KP 670.4; and KP 725.5 to KP 726.0.",Resolved,---,1.

Implement control measures to eradicate leafy spurge from right-of-way locations.,1. LOSS OF AGRICULTURAL CAPABILITY,,
Wind erosion on sandy soils and soils difficult to revegetate,See Environmental Alignment Sheets,"-  Topsoil piles were monitored for wind erosion. -  Appropriate seed mixes were sown on noncultivated portions.  Straw crimping was conducted. -  Straw crimping prevented soil erosion, many areas were reseeded in 2000.",Resolved,---,2. EROSION,,
Water erosion on moderately steep slopes,Moderately steep slopes to steep slopes See Environmental Alignment Sheets,"-  Temporary berms and silt fences were installed, where warranted. -  Cross ditches were installed, where warranted.  Seeded with cover crop and appropriate seed mix.  -  Watercourse crossings appeared to be stable and vegetation well established during summer 2000 post-construction monitoring.",Resolved,---,2. EROSION,,
Springs crossing right-of-way,KP 616.0,"-  In consultation with the landowner, the slopes were recontoured and local surface and subsurface drainage was realigned. -  No problems were evident during the summer 2000 post-construction monitoring program.",Resolved,---,2. EROSION,,
Disturbance of waterbody substrate and banks,"Qu'Appelle River, High Hill Creek, Cottonwood Creek and Wascana Creek",-  Appropriate vehicle crossings were installed.  Silt fences were installed around spoil storage area.  Vegetative buffers were left in place until immediately prior to construction.  The instream period was minimized and bed and banks were restored. -  Watercourse crossings appeared to be stable and vegetation well established during summer 2000 post-construction monitoring.,Resolved,---,3.  WATER CROSSINGS,,
Bank stability or approach slope erosion,"Qu'Appelle River, High Hill Creek, Cottonwood Creek and Wascana Creek","-  Temporary silt fences were installed during construction.  -  Banks and slopes were seeded.  -  Straw crimping was conducted, if warranted. -  Watercourse crossings appeared to be stable and vegetation well established during summer 2000 post-construction monitoring.",Resolved,---,3.  WATER CROSSINGS,,
Bank stability or approach slope erosion,Qu'Appelle River and Wascana Creek,-  Willow stake plugs and coconut matting (vegetated geogrid) were installed on the banks. -  Watercourse crossings appeared to be stable and vegetation well established during summer 2000 post-construction monitoring.,Resolved,---,3.  WATER CROSSINGS,,
Disturbance or encroachment on country residential subdivisions and urban areas,"Regina, White City, Montmartre and Kipling","-  Detailed Urban Construction Plans were developed in conjunc-tion with town/landowners.  The right-of-way was narrowed and traffic was controlled through town/farmyard areas.  Hours of construction were limited.  Con-struction was scheduled to avoid peak park use periods.  Baseball, swimming and golf seasons were over during construction period. -  Final clean-up in urban areas was scheduled for as early in the spring as feasible but inclement weather conditions postponed most activity to the late summer. -  No problems with revegetation were evident during the summer 2000 post-construction monitoring program.",Resolved,---,5. LAND USE,,
Natural drainage patterns,Entire route,-  Gaps were left in the topsoil pile at natural drainage ways during winter clean-up in 1998. -  The right-of-way was recontoured to the preconstruction profile and an appropriate trench crown was provided. <s>- </s>No drainage problems <s>were</s>evident during the summer 2000 post-construction moni-toring program.,Resolved,---,6.  DISRUPTION TO DRAINAGE,,
Loss of rare plants,KP 659.4,-  Seed pods of lotus-flowered milk-vetch were sown adjacent to the right-of-way. -  Plant not located during the summer 2000 post-construction monitoring program.,Unresolved,Monitor site during the 2001 post-construction monitoring program.,7. VEGETATION,,
Loss of rare plants,KP 731.8,"-  Two clumps of plants were trans-planted adjacent to the right-of-way. -  Two individual plants were located during the summer 2000 post-construction moni-toring program, but not the transplant clumps.",Unresolved,Monitor site during the 2001 post-construction monitoring program.,7. VEGETATION,,
Treflan concentration,KP 797.3 to KP 798.1,-  Landowner complaints about contaminated water washing from the right-of-way into low area were not justified.  The lab results of the water samples taken indicated no substantial increases of Treflan. -  No crop growth problems were evident during the summer 2000 post-construction monitoring program.,Resolved,---,"9.
