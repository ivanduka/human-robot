f)  Weed proliferation,KP 44.8 KP 133.0,Disturbed noncultivated portions of the route were fertilized and reseeded.,Unresolved,Monitor next year to determine reclamation seed growth and if excessive weed growth.  Mow and reseed if warranted.,1. LOSS OF AGRICULTURAL CAPABILITY,,
f)  Weed proliferation,KP 93.9 KP 99.3,Disturbed noncultivated portions of the route were fertilized and reseeded.,Unresolved,"Monitor and reseed, if warranted.",1. LOSS OF AGRICULTURAL CAPABILITY,,
a)  Wind erosion on  sandy soils,Redwillow Series Wainwright Series,Topsoil piles were monitored for wind erosion.  Overpicking of slash was avoided. Appropriate seed mixes were seeded on noncultivated portions.  Straw crimping was conducted.,Resolved,,2. EROSION,,
b)  Water erosion  on moderately  steep slopes,KP 44 to KP 47  KP 94.1,The slopes were seeded with appropriate mix and cover crop.,Resolved,,2. EROSION,,
b)  Water erosion  on moderately  steep slopes,KP 157.6 to KP 158.6 KP 159.8 to KP 161.2,"Slopes were final cleaned up and seeded with appropriate seed mix and cover crop.  Cross ditches were installed, where warranted.  Seeded with cover crop and appropriate seed mix. Conducted straw crimping.",Resolved,,2. EROSION,,
b)  Water erosion  on moderately  steep slopes,KP 164.2 to KP 167.4,Diversion berms were installed on slope at KP 167.4.  Remaining area was seeded with cover crop and appropriate seed mix.  Straw crimping was conducted.,Unresolved,Rill erosion evident at KP 167.3.  Regrading and reseeding in spring 2000.,2. EROSION,,
