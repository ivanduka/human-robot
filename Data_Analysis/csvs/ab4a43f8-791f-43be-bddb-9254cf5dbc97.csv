SW 32-96-11 W6,Forested Low/Moderate Vegetation Establishment,• <s>Low vegetation establishment observed with patches of moderate vegetation </s>establishment.,"July 3, 2016: • <s>Hydrovac hole remains along south side of station, along perimeter fencing. </s>• <s>Pipeline ROW immediately south of station exhibits poor soils contouring and poor vegetation cover. </s>• <s>Spoil pile remains within workspace along the edge of the pipeline ROW, to the south of compressor station; garbage </s>/ debris within spoil pile requires clean up. September 25, 2016: • <s>Hydrovac hole along south side of station, along perimeter fencing was repaired, issue resolved. </s>• <s>pipeline ROW immediately south of station was repaired to address poor contouring, issue resolved. </s>• <s>Garbage and woody debris was picked throughout the site, issue resolved. </s>• <s>Site was seeded with native seedmix. </s>",,,
SW 32-96-11 W6,Shrubby Fen Transition Zone Low/Moderate Vegetation Establishment,"• <s>Shrubby fen transition zone adjacent to compressor station footprint appears to be </s>functioning; impediments not observed (i.e., no ponded water or disturbance caused vegetation was readily apparent). • <s>Appropriate vegetation present adjacent to facility footprint (e.g., sedge species and </s>willow species). • <s>Appropriate vegetation re-establishment within compressor station footprint in non-</s>gravelled areas.","Vegetation cover showing moderate improvements. There are no issues with invasive or noxious weeds species noted in these areas, therefore no additional remediation measures are recommended. Continue to monitor the vegetation recovery.",,,
SW 32-96-11 W6,Treed Bog Low/Moderate Vegetation Establishment,"• <s>Bog adjacent to compressor station footprint appears to be functioning; impediments not </s>observed (i.e., no ponded water or disturbance caused vegetation was readily apparent). • <s>Appropriate vegetation present adjacent to facility footprint (e.g., black spruce, Labrador </s>tea and peat mosses). • <s>Appropriate vegetation re-establishment within compressor station footprint in non-</s>gravelled areas.","Vegetation cover showing moderate improvements. There are no issues with invasive or noxious weeds species noted in these areas, therefore no additional remediation measures are recommended. Continue to monitor the vegetation recovery.",,,
SW 32-96-11 W6,Forested Rare Plant,• <s>No golden saxifrage (S3?) was observed. Unresolved – habitat is suitable for this species. </s>Monitor in 2016.,"August 20, 2016 Species not observed at the transplant location. Golden Saxifrage is now ranked as an S4 (apparently secure, taxon is uncommon but not rare) (ACIMS, 2016). As the species is no longer considered rare in Alberta, no further monitoring will be conducted on the Project. Issue resolved.",,,
