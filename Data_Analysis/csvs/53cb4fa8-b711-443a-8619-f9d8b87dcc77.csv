a) Compaction,Entire route,"- Soils were dry throughout the construction program and compaction was of limited concern. - The use of compaction alleviation measures (e.g., ripping, chisel plowing and paratilling) was limited at some locations due to concerns related to additional soil drying and pulverization. - Nevertheless, some residual compaction may remain at locations where compaction alleviation measures were not implemented. - Drought conditions prevented assessment during the 2002 post-construction monitoring program.",Unresolved,"- Monitor crop response in 2003 and take penetrometer readings where warranted.  Take remedial measures (e.g., paratill) if severe compaction is evident.",1. LOSS OF AGRICULTURAL CAPABILITY,,

No erosion was evident.",Resolved,---,3. WATER CROSSINGS,,
a) Natural drainage patterns,Entire route,- Gaps were left in the topsoil pile at natural drainage ways during topsoil salvage operations. - The right-of-way was recontoured to the preconstruction profile and an appropriate trench crown was provided. - No drainage problems were noted during the 2002 post-construction monitoring program.,Resolved,---,4. DISRUPTION TO DRAINAGE,,
a) Loss of rare plants,KP 177.75 to KP 177.79,"- In order to protect sand millet, the work side was narrowed by ~5 m, no grading was allowed and a blade width of sod was salvaged and placed on straw matting.  The sod was then replaced and straw from the matting was then spread over the replaced sod.  Low milkweed at KP 177.7 were transplanted prior to commencement of construction. - No sand millet was located during the 2002 post-construction monitoring program.  Sod pieces were not rooted well.",Unresolved,- Monitor the success of the sand millet and low milkweed reestablishment in 2003.,5. VEGETATION,,
