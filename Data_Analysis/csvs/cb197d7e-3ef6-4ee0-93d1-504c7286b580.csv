August 14, 2018 - Class III wetland on ROW from KP 2+470 to 2+540 appears to be at baseline (pre-construction) conditions with no net apparent loss of wetland function observed. Proper wetland functionality has been attained. Wetland is inclusive of riparian zone to Unnamed Creek at KP 2+500. - Vegetation establishment throughout wetland is at 80-100% cover compared to off ROW control.  - Vegetation consisting of herbaceous graminoids and willows. Good establishment of hydrophytic vegetation (common cattail, lily pads, duck weed water milfoil). - No trench crown present through wetland; hydrology has been maintained across ROW with no apparent signs of any hydrologic connectivity issues. - Substrate in wetland appears healthy through uniform vegetation growth and high moisture retention capabilities. Some humification occurring throughout wetland through the decomposing vegetation litter. High organic content in topsoil layer; comparing with off RoW conditions. Organic scent emitting from standing water areas indicating the effective decomposition of plant material via bacterial organisms. - Substrate exhibiting semi-saturated conditions leading into the watercourse with a depth of >40cm. No issues of flow observed within watercourse. - Wetland providing good habitat opportunity through good vegetation cover, sufficient snags and standing water. Amphibians observed using wetland as habitat. - Wetland has achieved pre-construction contours with no signs of ponding, soil stability, erosion or subsidence issues.
