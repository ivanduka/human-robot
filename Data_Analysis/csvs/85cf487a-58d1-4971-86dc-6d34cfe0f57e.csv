a)Compaction,Entire route,"-Soils were dry throughout the constructionprogram and compaction was of limitedconcern.-The use of compaction alleviation measures (e.g., ripping, chisel plowing and paratilling)was limited at some locations due toconcerns related to additional soil drying and pulverization.-Nevertheless, some residual compactionmay remain at locations where compactionalleviation measures were not implemented.-Drought conditions prevented assessmentduring the 2002 post-constructionmonitoring program. -Areal reconnaissance indicated no compaction issues.",Resolved,---,1.LOSS OF AGRICULTURAL CAPABILITY,,
b) Weed proliferation,Entire route,"-Disturbed noncultivated portions of the routewere reseeded.  Certificates of analysis of the seeds were reviewed and retained.-Straw used in crimping operations was obtained from the landowner or approved by the landowner prior to use.-Weed control implemented, where warranted, by Enbridge.-Most weed issues are resolved with thefollowing exceptions:",Resolved,---,1.LOSS OF AGRICULTURAL CAPABILITY,,

The plants,their root systems and the affected soil wereexcavated, loaded into trucks and transported to the Hardisty soil remediation site where oil contaminated soils are incinerated.-Plants were removed where found during the 2002 post-construction monitoringprogram.-A patch of 100-200 plants found and removed at KP 177.97.  No leafy spurgefound from KP 178.21 to KP 178.22 or atKP 182.3.",Unresolved,-Monitor for leafy spurge infestationin 2004 at KP 177.97.,1.LOSS OF AGRICULTURAL CAPABILITY,,
b) Weed proliferation,KP 234.7,"-Topsoil from a 20 m x 30 m area infestedwith yellow toadflax was salvaged and stockpiled separately from adjacenttopsoils.During clean-up the topsoil was replaced over its preconstruction location.  Equipmentinvolved in topsoil salvage and replacementactivities were cleaned prior to proceeding down the right-of-way.-Large patch (1000’s of plants) found on and off of the right-of-way at this location during the 2002 post-construction monitoringprogram.-No yellow toadflax identifiable, but pasture heavily overgrazed.",Unresolved,-Control and monitor as necessaryin 2004.,1.LOSS OF AGRICULTURAL CAPABILITY,,
a) Bank stabilityor erosion ofapproaches tothe creek,Eyehill CreekKP 272.2,"-Banks and approaches were seeded.-Straw crimping was conducted, where warranted.-Good revegetation noted during the 2002 post-construction monitoring program.  Noerosion was evident.-Good revegetation noted during the 2003 overflight.",Resolved,---,3. WATER CROSSINGS,,
a)Loss of rare plants,KP 177.75 toKP 177.79,"-In order to protect sand millet, the work sidewas narrowed by ~5 m, no grading was allowed and a blade width of sod was salvaged and placed on straw matting. Thesod was then replaced and straw from thematting was then spread over the replaced sod.  Low milkweed at KP 177.7 were transplanted prior to commencement ofconstruction.-No sand millet was located during the 2002 post-construction monitoring program.  Sodpieces were not rooted well.-No sand millet found.  Pasture had beengrazed.",Unresolved,-Monitor the success of the sand millet and low milkweedreestablishment in early summer 2004.,5.

a)Loss of rare plants,KP 193.03,-A tree spade was used to transplantfourburr oaks to north side of the right-of-wayand a fifth was transplanted by hand.  No brushing was allowed within 50 m until thetransplanting was completed.-3 of the transplanted saplings were locatedduring the 2002 post-constructionmonitoring program and an additional3 saplings were found growing naturally.-Saplings found to be surviving in 2003.,Resolved,---,5.

a)Loss of rare plants,KP 272.85 toKP 272.9,"-The work side was narrowed by ~10 m, nograding was allowed and swamp mats were placed on the work side in order to protectlittle bluestem. Sod salvage was notfeasible due to hummocky terrain.  Strawwas spread on the spoil side prior totrenching to avoid scalping of the sod layerduring backfill.-Conditions were very dry, but hummocky community appears to have retained itsdiversity.  No plants were found during the2002 post-construction monitoring program.-Hot and dry conditions.  No rare plantsfound during the 2003 monitoringprogram.",Unresolved,-Monitor the success of themitigation in early summer 2004.,5. VEGETATION,,
