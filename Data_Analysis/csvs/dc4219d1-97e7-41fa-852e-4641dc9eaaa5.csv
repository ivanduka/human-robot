(a)    Coarse fragments,Entire route,•    No coarse fragment issues observed along the right-of-way in 2013.,Resolved,None required.,No concerns noted.,1. PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT,,
(b)    Contouring and drainage,Various,"•    Drainage issues observed from KP 22.142 to KP 22.246, and at KP 23.160.",Unresolved,"Monitor in 2015 and, if warranted, re-contour the right-of-way as close to the pre-construction profile as possible.","KKP 22.142 to KP 22.246 - Minor water ponding occurs primarily in the spring (this is a naturally low lying area).  The vegetative cover continues to establish and no detrimental effects should be expected, or further action required. P 23.160 – Surface drainage is adequate (minor ponding may occur for short periods during very wet conditions – this area is also low lying) and vegetative cover has established.  No detrimental effects should be expected, or further action required.",1. PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT,,
(a)      Topsoil/strippings admixing,Various,"• Surface admixing was observed at KP 3.401. • Surface admixing was observed from KP 4.646 to KP 4.749, however, this coincides with the location of a pre-existing wetland so the soil differences observed may be attributed to pre-existing conditions. No vegetation was present to assess establishment.",Unresolved,"Monitor in 2015 for vegetation establishment and, if warranted, source and add clean topsoil/strippings material.",KSKP 3.401 – Vegetative cover has established.  The landowner does plan to cultivate and seed this location in conjunction with his adjacent fields. P 4.646 to KP 4.749 – This is a drainage / wet site that has re-established well with suitable surface flows and vegetative cover. ee Photo 14 and 14a in Section 5.4 regarding the admixing concerns observed in 2013 at KP 4.749.,2. SOIL AND SOIL PRODUCTIVITY,,
(b)      Degradation of soil structure and lowering of soil productivity through compaction and rutting,Various,"• Compaction was observed from KP 3.192 to KP 3.325, 13.333 to KP 13.350, and KP 13.901 to KP 13.934. • Compaction resulting from soil disturbance caused by cattle observed from KP 9.693 to KP 9.750, KP 9.861 to KP 9.914, KP 10.302 to KP 10.370, KP 10.451 to KP 10.623, and KP 10.622 to KP 10.704. • Compaction resulting from third party vehicle or recreational vehicle use was observed from KP 16.331 to KP 16.362, KP 16.702 to KP 17.133, KP 17.162 to KP 17.263, and KP 23.528.",Unresolved,"Monitor in 2015 and, if warranted, alleviate compaction.","AWSee Table 1 - 2015 PCEM Environmental Issues List for comments regarding soil compaction and rutting. ith the exception of the items noted in Table 1 all sites on the Project  right-of-way are fully vegetated or under active cultivation, or under active livestock management. s an example the compaction observed in the 2013 field assessment from KP 3.192 to KP 3.325 was the direct result of track packing on the steep slopes at Lynx Creek to achieve adequate compaction for slope stability and the prevention of erosion.  The 2015 inspection verified that these slopes are stable, no erosion has occurred and there is extensive vegetative cover throughout the riparian zone and above the breaks in slope (e.g. no concerns were noted throughout this area).",2. SOIL AND SOIL PRODUCTIVITY,,
(c)    Soil erosion,Various,"• Areas of soil erosion observed at KP 1.730, KP 2.310, KP 2.508 to KP 2.485, KP 10.376 to KP 10.620, KP 14.442 to KP 14.542, from KP 17.895 to KP 17.988, KP 21.591, KP 21.662, KP 22.001 and KP 23.736. • Areas of erosion resulting from third party recreational vehicle use were observed at KP 20.484 and KP 21.722.",Unresolved,Monitor  vegetation  establishment  and erosion in 2015.,"WSee Table 1 - 2015 PCEM Environmental Issues List for comments regarding soil erosion. ith  the  exception  of  the  items  noted  in  Table 1, no  additional  gully  or  channel  erosion  was  noted on the  Project  right-of-way.   Many  of the  sites noted in the  2013  assessment  are  now  under active cultivation or fully vegetated and stabilized.",2. SOIL AND SOIL PRODUCTIVITY,,
(d)    Trench subsidence or remnant trench crown,Entire route,• No subsidence issues observed along the right-of-way in 2013.,Resolved,None required.,No concerns noted.,2. SOIL AND SOIL PRODUCTIVITY,,
(a)      Alterations of natural flow patterns,Various,• No issues observed at watercourse crossings. • The contouring and drainage issues noted above could potentially affect natural flow patterns. • A spring was discovered on southwest corner of Lynx Creek approach during construction. rip-rap was installed to extend up the approach slope that. effectively stabilized slope and prevented slumping and erosion.,Resolved,See 1.(b) Contouring and drainage.,No concerns noted. Item 1.(b) Contouring and drainage has been addressed above.,3. WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY,,
(a)      Vegetation establishment,Various,"•    Establishment issues observed on Crown land at KP 0.525, KP 1.163 to KP 1.350, and KP 1.524 to KP 1.985. •    Unable to adequately assess vegetation establishment on Crown land from KP 0.000 to KP 0.317 because area has not been seeded. Unable to adequately assess vegetation establishment on Crown land from KP 18.721 to KP 24.300 due to seeding in August 2013. •    Unable to assess vegetation establishment on private land at KP 3.044,  KP 3.384 to KP 7.520, KP 8.226 to KP 12.765, and KP 12.861 to KP 17.944. Areas not seeded by landowners at the time of survey.",Unresolved,"Continue to monitor the establishment of vegetation on the right-of-way in 2015 and reseed Crown land, if warranted.","NWSSee Table 1 - 2015 PCEM Environmental Issues List for comments regarding vegetation establishment. ote that the 2013 field assessments were conducted immediately after the clean-up was completed.  As a result much of the seed had not yet germinated or become established.   ith the exception of the items noted in Table 1 all sites on the Project  right-of-way are fully vegetated or under active cultivation. ee Photos 13 / 13a, 15 / 15a, 16 / 16a, 17 / 17a, 18 / 18a and 19 / 19a in Section 5.4 regarding establishment concerns observed in 2013 at KPs 3.044, 7.037, 10.094, 17.058, 21.610 and 23.902.",4. VEGETATION,,
(b)      Weed introduction and spread,Various,"•Weed issue observed on private land from KP 8.226 to KP 12.765 and KP 12.861 to KP 14.241. Areas have not yet been seeded. •Low density of Canada thistle observed from KP 9.651 to KP 10.701, and KP 16.562 to KP 17.055. All observations on private land. •Low density of wild oats observed from KP 13.162 to KP 13.350 on private land.",Unresolved,"Following seeding, desirable species will likely out-compete the weeds. Continue monitoring right-of-way in 2015 for weed growth and introduction as well as weed problem areas.",Weed growth was not observed to be an issue during the 2015 PCEM inspection on this line.  See footnotes in Table 1 - 2015 PCEM Environmental Issues List for additional comments regarding weeds. Also note that extensive vegetative growth (of planted species) and landowner cultivation and cropping have controlled or eliminated many of the original weed concerns noted in 2013.,VEC,GIS,Topic
