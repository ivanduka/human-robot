36,120+360,SW 7-9-28 W1,watercourse crossing (tributary to Pipestone Creek),"erosion, riparian woody vegetation","August 2013: Significant erosion, including a large gully and rills, of the south slope. Erosion is releasing sedimentation into the creek, resulting in narrowing the creek. South slope is unstable. Erosion blanket was found to be installed with spacing to the ground and only few anchors. The largest gully erosion has formed directly above the pipeline. Top of slope slumping has occurred approximately 0.5 m from the slope. On the north slope an area of missing topsoil was identified. Some silt fences installed in a way that directs water down the slope encouraging erosion. Silt fences not maintained properly. Removal of woody species from the riparian area has increased direct sunlight, possibly resulting in an algae bloom localized at the crossing location. Coarse Woody Debris was removed and placed upstream and downstream of crossing, restricting flow.",Pipestone Tributary - coconut mat is still in place. No noticeable erosion on the banks. Some minor erosion on creek bed. No subsidence through riparian area,"May 2014: The slope failure on the south approach identified in 2013 inspections was re-contoured and rolled erosion control product (RECP) was installed. However, RECP installation was not carried to the top of the slope (it stopped approximately 2-3 m from the top of slope) and material was not sufficiently anchored. Surface drainage (e.g., from precipitation) originating at the top of the slope has formed gully erosion under the RECP. Sediment fence installed on the southeast side of the crossing is located in an area which is now stabilized and is no longer required.","Due to significant rainfall, south bank became unstable and the bank slid down. Most of the material appears to be contained within the coconut matting and appears to have not yet reached the creek. September 2014 - excavator utilized to pull material up and re-contour south bank. RECP installed on bank and carried over the top of the bank. Slight swale was installed and armoured using RECP and rip-rap rock to divert surface drainage to vegetated slope",South bank re-contoured and eroded areas repaired.  Silt fences were removed and reinstalled where erosion was most likely.,unresolved,Monitor,,,
