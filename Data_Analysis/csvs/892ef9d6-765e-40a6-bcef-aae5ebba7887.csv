Temporary bridges and swamp mats,"Where access was not available on either side of a watercourse or wetland, temporary bridges and swamp mats were used for crossing.",AAll temporary bridges and swamp mats were removed. ll approaches straw mulched to prevent bank erosion.,Unresolved,"Monitoring of • stream banks, bridge approaches, and access trails to ensure stabilization and erosion control measures implemented in 2007 and 2008 were successful.",,,
Corduroy,Corduroy was used to access structures located in wetlands.,"The removal of approximately 4000 m3 of wood from the Hanson Stream wetland (structures 29 to 31).  The wood and geo-grid was removed, recycled and utilized by Brunswick Pipeline for use as rip-rap underlay.  Most of the corduroy along the right-of-way was removed in 2008.  In some cases it was determined that corduroy removal would be more detrimental than to leave in.",Unresolved,NRemoval of • corduroy between structures 148 to 150. Reclaim access trail • by mulching and seeding area. ote: The Hanson Stream wetland appears to be in very good shape and should recover in 2009 and the following growing seasons.,,,
Site stabilization,Disturbed areas where activities were undertaken,Seeded and mulched a number of areas along the right-of-way and access trails and roads.,Unresolved,Seed and mulch all • access trails around wetlands.      Monitor success of • stabilization and erosion control measures on slopes at various locations along the right-of-way,,,
Structure locations,Work area around the structure locations,Seeded and straw mulched around the work area of structures,Unresolved,At the time of this • report structures 160 and 162 required seeding and mulching. Monitoring of the • stabilization and erosion control measures implemented in 2008 to ensure they were successful.,,,
Brunswick Pipeline shared right-of-way,The newly constructed Brunswick Pipeline parallels and shares the IPL right-of-way for a considerable distance.,"Although Brunswick Pipeline has implemented measures during construction to mitigate impacts, a number of locations on the IPL right-of-way have been impacted by pipeline activities (e.g. temporary work room, spoil piles, corduroy, rock rip-rap, etc).",Unresolved,Work closely with • representatives of Brunswick Pipeline to address issues and concerns noted on the Environmental Issues List.,,,
