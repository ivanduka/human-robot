At flagged rare plant locations, • stripped a narrow blade width centred over the trench. If rare plants were flagged in areas where grading was required, stripped and stored grubbings and strippings separately and marked their location to ensure these materials were replaced in the same area during clean‐up. At flagged rare plant locations, • placed swamp or rig mats over the spoil side and placed ditch spoil on top of the mats, to prevent ditch spoil from mixing with the unstripped surface materials. Replaced strippings in areas of • rare plants in the same location as they were removed.","Revisited rare plant • populations of European water-hemlock, northern bog bedstraw and western Jacob's-ladder.",8 Unresolved** 22 Resolved**,Continue to monitor the 8 unresolved populations of rare plants in July 2012.,5.
