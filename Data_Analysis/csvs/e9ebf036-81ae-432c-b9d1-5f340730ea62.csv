Environmental Issues,Location,Mitigative Measures and Observations in 2013,Status,Recommendations,VEC,GIS,Topic
(a) Course fragments,Entire route,"No course fragment issues were observed along • the right-of-way. At areas where course fragments (mulch, stones, woody debris, etc.) were observed, vegetation was noted to be establishing and not hindered unacceptably by the presence/depth of the course fragments.",Resolved,None.,1. PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT,,
(b) Surface drainage,Entire route,Recontouring of the ground surface was • successful along the right-of-way.  The subsidence issue noted below is affecting • surface cross drainage.,Unresolved,See 2.(d) trench subsidence.,1. PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT,,
(a) Strippings/ subsoil mixing,Entire route,No areas of admixing of subsoil with topsoil were • observed along the right-of-way.,Resolved,None.,2. SOIL AND SOIL PRODUCTIVITY,,
(b) Compaction and rutting,Entire route,No areas of compaction or rutting were observed • along the right-of-way.,Resolved,None.,2. SOIL AND SOIL PRODUCTIVITY,,
(c) Soil erosion,Entire route,No areas of soil erosion were observed along the • right-of-way. ,Resolved,None.,2. SOIL AND SOIL PRODUCTIVITY,,
(d) Trench subsidence,KP 1.00 to KP 1.80,Trench line subsidence (approximately • 1.5 m wide x 0.3 m deep) was observed along the right-of-way from KP 1.00 to KP 1.80.,Unresolved,Recontour the right-of-way as close to the pre-construction profile as possible in winter 2013/2014; monitor in 2014.,2. SOIL AND SOIL PRODUCTIVITY,,
(a) Alterations of natural flow patterns,Entire route,Recontouring of the ground surface was • successful as no drainage issues were observed along the right-of-way.  The subsidence issue noted above could • potentially affect natural flow patterns.,Resolved,See 2.(d) trench subsidence.,3. WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY,,
(a) Loss of wetland habitat and loss or reduction of hydrological function (filtration),Entire route,No loss of wetland habitat or reduction of • hydrological function was observed. The subsidence issue noted above may affect • drainage patterns within the wetland.,Resolved,See 2.(d) trench subsidence.,4. WETLANDS,,
(a) Loss or alteration of native vegetation and vegetation important to wildlife,Entire route,Vegetation re-establishment appears to be on a • positive trajectory along the right-of-way.,Resolved,None.,5. VEGETATION,,
(b) Weed introduction and spread,Entire route,•  Weeds were not observed to be an issue along the right-of-way.,Resolved,None.,5. VEGETATION,,
(a) Loss or alteration of potential wildlife habitat,Entire route,Vegetation important for wildlife habitat is • successfully establishing.,Resolved,None.,6. WILDLIFE AND WILDLIFE HABITAT,,
(a) Disruption of low-lying wet areas that act as filtration systems,Entire route,The subsidence issue noted above is not likely to • affect the filtration systems associated with wetlands.,Resolved,None.,7. TRADITIONAL LAND USE,,
