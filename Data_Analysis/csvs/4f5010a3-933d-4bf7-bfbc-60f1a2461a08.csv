TNew Pipeline in Alberta  rench subsidence,"22010 - Approx. 90 sites in 110 km section between;  Section 2-31-4-W4 and  Section 34-22-4-W4.  011 – In addition to areas noted above, all land tracts were assessed in 2011.","The total area within the 110 km section is approx. 1.8 ha. Typical areas are 20m in length, 2-3 m wide and < 0.3m deep.","•  Numerous site deficiencies were corrected by stripping back topsoil and feathering in subsoil, or if very small or possibly in pasture/ native range, acceptable topsoil sources are secured and used to fill-in trench subsidence.  •  Sites were assessed with remediation completed on areas with potential to impact landowner and/ or pipeline operations.","•  Numerous areas (approx. 2500m or 1.4 ha) were corrected by stripping back topsoil and feathering in subsoil, or if acceptable topsoil sources could be secured, topsoil was used to fill-in minor trench subsidence.  •  Sites were assessed with remediation completed on areas with potential to impact landowner and/ or pipeline operations.","•  Numerous areas (approx. 3500m or 2.5 ha) were corrected by stripping back topsoil and feathering in subsoil, or if acceptable topsoil sources could be secured, topsoil was used to fill-in minor trench subsidence.  •  Sites were assessed with remediation completed on areas with potential to impact landowner and/ or pipeline operations.","•  Numerous areas (approx. 9100m or 9.1 ha) were corrected, using combinations of stripping back topsoil and feathering in subsoil, or if acceptable topsoil sources could be secured, topsoil was used to fill-in minor trench subsidence.  •  Sites were assessed with remediation completed on areas with potential to impact landowner and/ or pipeline operations.","•  Approx. 450m at 49 locations were corrected, using combinations of stripping back topsoil and feathering in subsoil, or if acceptable topsoil sources could be secured, topsoil was used to fill-in minor trench subsidence.  •  Sites were assessed with remediation completed on areas with potential to impact landowner and/ or pipeline operations.","•  The 49 sites noted from the 2015 program were assessed and monitored in 2016.  •  Contours are good, erosion issues are non-existent, and there are no concerns with vegetation establishment. •  Invasive species controlled to a level comparable to adjacent lands.",PNo further work or monitoring required. CEM is considered complete on all sites.,,,
New Pipeline in Manitoba  Potential land levelling,"Areas on numerous tracts. Sizes ranging from 5 m length to 200 m length, and 5 m wide to full width of right-of-way.","2010 helicopter reconnaissance with video capability, some ground recon, as well as discussions with landowners noted inconsistencies in contours across the right-of-way. Land levelling completed in a few locations in 2010.",•  Land-levelling completed on various land-tracts in 2011.  •  2011 assessments determined uneven field surface contours (high spots/low spots).  •  Normal farm practices do not readily correct these inconsistencies.,•  Land-levelling completed on various land-tracts in 2012.,•  Land-levelling completed on various land-tracts in 2013.,•  Land-levelling completed on 29 various land-tracts in 2014. •  All areas on the New Pipeline in Manitoba segment completed in 2014.,"•  During the 2015 monitoring period as well as consultation with landowners, 10 out of the 29 tracts that were completed in 2014 required some fine tuning/ levelling to address minor drainage issues.",•  Monitoring in 2016 determined all sites have been addressed.  •  Based on consultation all landowners are satisfied with the remedial repairs from previous years.,PNo further work or monitoring required. CEM is considered complete on all sites.,,,
New Pipeline in Alberta  Shrub Planting,Ribstone Creek,Work not completed in 2010.,"•  Planted approximately 170 Manitoba Maple and Chokecherry on banks, completed in June 2011.","•  Assessed area and determined that success was not adequate due to utilizing potted stock that was not mature enough for the site conditions. •  Larger/ more mature potted stock (115 plants) was planted in June 2012 and monitored throughout the growing season, with much better success to date.","•  Larger/ more mature potted stock (75 willow, maple and chokecherry plants) were planted in June 2013. •  Assessed area and determined that success appears to be adequate at this time. •  Livestock continue to have some affect when electric fencing is breached.",•  3 shrubs on the north side and 6 shrubs on the south side appear to be surviving from the planting in June 2013. •  Livestock continue to have some affect when electric fencing is breached.,"•  In additional to shrubs noted in 2014, encroachment of native forbs and shrubs from the ROW boundaries. •  Slopes are stable. •  Minor erosion on the south bank as a result of livestock watering on the ROW. Gravel / cobble was placed in September 2015 to repair the erosion.",•  Assessed the site at the appropriate time in the 2016 growing season. Verified that the willow plantings are sufficient and providing a level of confidence that reclamation objectives are continuing to be successful. •  South bank repairs from 2015 remained stable in 2016. No further concerns.,PNo further work or monitoring required.  CEM is considered to be complete.,,,
