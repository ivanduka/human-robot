Compaction,KP 669.2 to KP 670.4;  KP 725.5 to KP 726.0,--  Compaction layer in sandy soil at 15 to 20 cm.  Needs to be ripped with subsoiler plow.   KP 669.2 to KP 670.4; Subsoil compaction still evident in 2001.  Subsoil ripping was not completed in fall 2001 due to dry conditions. -  KP 725.5 to KP 726.0; Subsoil compaction still evident in 2001. Subsoil ripping was not completed in fall 2001 due to dry conditions.,Resolved,PLM to complete subsoil ripping and monitor crop growth in 2002 KP 699.2 to KP 670.4: PLM personnel will rip subsoil in 2002 when conditions are appropriate. Manure will be added by landowner and worked in. KP 725.5 to KP 726.0: PLM personnel will rip subsoil in 2002 when conditions are appropriate. Area will be reseeded.,1. LOSS OF AGRICULTURAL CAPABILITY,,
Weed proliferation,KP 663.0 to KP 664.0;  KP 724.8 to KP 726.0;  KP 926.9 to KP 927.0,"--  May require seeding and weed control during the 2001 growing season.   KP 663.0 to KP 664.0; Seed rows visible, but still weedy. -  KP 724.8 to KP 726.0; leafy spurge noted on the right-of-way in 2001.  Midland Vegetation sprayed weeds mid-October and will monitor in spring 2002. -  KP 926.9 to KP 927.0; Weedy, but some seed catch under weeds.",Resolved,PLM to monitor revegetation and weed growth in 2002 Weed control will be implemented in areas as needed,1. LOSS OF AGRICULTURAL CAPABILITY,,
Weed proliferation,KP 676.8 to KP 677.5,--  Leafy spurge noted on right-of-way. -  Leafy spurge noted and eradi-cated during summer 2000 post-construction monitoring. -  May require further weed control during the 2001 growing season.  No leafy spurge noted in 2001.,Resolved,-,1. LOSS OF AGRICULTURAL CAPABILITY,,
Water erosion on moderately steep slopes,KP 731.8,-  KP 731.8; Deep rill erosion on the slope adjacent to the gravel pit.  Leafy spurge noted on the right-of-way.,Resolved,Regrading will be undertaken by PLM Midland Vegetation will implement weed control PLM to monitor erosion and weed growth in 2002,2. EROSION,,
Loss of rare plants,KP 659.4,--  Seed pods of lotus-flowered milkvetch were sown adjacent to the right-of-way. -  Plant not located during the summer 2000 post-construction monitoring program.   Rare plant found growing at edge of right-of-way.,Resolved,-,7. VEGETATION,,
Loss of rare plants,KP 731.8,"--  Two clumps of plants were transplanted adjacent to the right-of-way. -  Two individual plants were located during the summer 2000 post-construction monitoring program, but not the transplant clumps.   The transplanted clumps were identified, but the gentian was not found.",Resolved,-,7. VEGETATION,,
