(a) Slope and fill stability,Entire route,See Soil and Soil Productivity element −,Unresolved,See Soil and Soil Productivity element,1. PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT,,
(a) Strippings / subsoil mixing,Entire route,Strippings were replaced over the stripped areas − along the pipeline route. Surface admixing was observed at KP 2.1. −,Unresolved,"Continue monitoring the re-establishment of ground cover, soil erosion potential and weed growth in 2009.",2. SOIL AND SOIL PRODUCTIVITY,,
(b) Degradation of soil structure and lowering of soil productivity through compaction and rutting,Entire route,No areas of compaction or rutting were observed − along the right-of-way in 2008. Construction activities occurred during frozen − conditions.,Resolved,N/A,2. SOIL AND SOIL PRODUCTIVITY,,
(c) Trench subsidence,Entire route,Trench line subsidence occurs along the length of − the pipeline route.,Unresolved,Recontour the right-of-way as close to the preconstruction profile as possible.,2. SOIL AND SOIL PRODUCTIVITY,,
(a) Alterations of natural flow patterns,Entire route,All corduroy and geotextile matting along the right-of-− way was removed post-construction in order to avoid interfering with natural drainage patterns and ensure adequate cross drainage across right-of-way.,Unresolved,Continue monitoring trench settlement along the right-of-way in 2009.,3. WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY,,
(a) Loss or alteration of native vegetation and vegetation important to wildlife,Entire route,"Minimal clearing (approximately 5.2 ha) was required − since the right-of-way parallels existing linear disturbances and previously disturbed lands. Few low-growing shrubs and grasses were observed − along the right-of-way at the time of the PCM program. Control trees and shrubs, if necessary, to facilitate − pipeline surveillance, by mechanical rather than chemical means.",Unresolved,Continue to monitor the re-establishment of low-growing shrubs and grasses on the right-of-way in 2009.,4. VEGETATION,,
(b) Weed introduction and spread,Entire route,No weeds of concern were identified during the PCM − program.,Resolved,Continue monitoring for weed growth and introduction in during normal Operations and Maintenance activities.,4. VEGETATION,,
(c) Loss of merchantable timber,Entire route,Minimal clearing (approximately 5.2 ha) was − required. Merchantable timber was salvaged in accordance − with provincial forestry officers and local timber companies with dispositions in the area.,Resolved,N/A,4. VEGETATION,,
(d) Acceleration of the spread of mountain pine beetle,Entire route,Pipeline routing included following existing − disturbances for the majority of the pipeline route. Pine trees were inspected prior to salvage to − determine level of infestation (if any). Tree removal occurred prior to beetle flight (May 1). − Damage to residual trees along the right-of-way was − minimized to limit the infection and spread of mountain pine beetle.,Resolved,N/A,4. VEGETATION,,
(a) Loss or alteration of potential wildlife habitat,Entire route,See Vegetation element −,Unresolved,See Vegetation element,5. WILDLIFE AND WILDLIFE HABITAT,,
(b) Sensory disturbance of wildlife,Entire route,"In order to minimize the length of the open ditch and − reduce the time the trench was open, the pipeline was lowered in and the trench was backfilled soon after being excavated.",Resolved,N/A,5. WILDLIFE AND WILDLIFE HABITAT,,
"(a) Disruption of hunting, guiding and trapping activities",Entire route,"Local trappers, guide outfitters and the general public − were notified of the project and construction schedule prior to commencement of project activities.",Resolved,N/A,6. HUMAN OCCUPANCY AND RESOURCE USE,,
(a) Loss of heritage resources,Entire route,"A Preliminary Field Reconnaissance was conducted − along the proposed route within BC during fall 2007. No areas of archaeological concern were identified within the project area (TERA 2007). Burlington received Historical Resources Act − clearance for the proposed project from Alberta Culture and Community Spirit on September 25, 2007 (TERA 2007). No new archaeological, palaeontological or historical − finds were encountered along the pipeline route during construction.",Resolved,N/A,7. HERITAGE RESOURCES,,
