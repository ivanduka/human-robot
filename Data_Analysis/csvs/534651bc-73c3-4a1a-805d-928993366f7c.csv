SE 1-54-15,wetland,Vegetation issue (moderate),0+000 to 0+060,"The  ROW  is  revegetating  well,  but  few  wetland  species  were  observed  during  the  field  survey.  The majority of the wetland and wetland species appear to be north of the pipeline ROW, the construction of the pipeline has had limited to no impact on the vegetative composition of the ROW.",Monitor in 2015,,,
SE 1-54-15,wetland,Noxious weed issue (moderate),0+000 to 0+075,Noxious weeds are present (Canada thistle and perennial sow thistle). Noxious weeds are more severe off ROW.,"Monitor in 2015 and implement appropriate weed control, if required.",,,
SW 6-54-14,cropland,Noxious weed issue (low),0+075 to 0+250,"Located  on  a  small  natural  wet  area.  Noxious  weeds  (Canada  thistle  and  perennial  sow  thistle)  are present, which will be managed by normal farming operations.",None,,,
SW 6-54-14,cropland,Noxious weed issue (low),0+415 to 0+465,Site  is  on  the  edge  of  a  small  natural  wet  area  that  extends  25m  to  the  south  of  the  ROW.  Noxious weeds (Canada thistle) are present.,None,,,
SW 6-54-14,cropland,No issue observed,0+700,Crop is comparable to the Control. Landowner’s refuse storage site was located just off the ROW.,None,,,
SW 6-54-14,wetland,Noxious weed issue (moderate),0+720 to 0+760,"Class  II  wetland  observed.  Scentless  chamomile  was  observed  on  the  ROW.  Moderate  issue  as  the noxious weeds were picked, bagged and sealed in a plastic bag and properly disposed of (approx. 10 plants).",Monitor in 2015 and implement appropriate weed control if necessary,,,
SW 6-54-14,cropland,Microtopography issue (Moderate),0+775 to 0+855,There  is  approximately  a  5  cm  to  10  cm  difference  between  grade  on  and  off  ROW.  This  may  be associated with an old fence line. Topsoil was greater than 29 cm was observed on the ROW and on the control. The uneven topography can be attributed to the old fence line. No soil issues were observed.,None,,,
SW 6-54-14,cropland,Vegetation issue (moderate),0+775 to 0+855,Crop height and density decreased compared to the off-ROW Control. Noxious weeds (Canada thistle) are present which will be managed by normal farming operations.,Monitor in 2015,,,
SE 6-54-14,Treed (wind break),Vegetation issue (high),0+900 to 0+920,Drainage ditch (man-made) to the east. High percent cover of invasive plants and nuisance weeds were observed; few desirable species present.,"Monitor in 2015 and reseed with an approved seed mixture if natural regeneration is not providing adequate recovery. Implement appropriate weed control, if necessary.",,,
SE 6-54-14,cropland,Vegetation issue (moderate),0+925 to 1+300,"There is a decrease in crop height and density compared to off-ROW Control. No soil issues on the ROW  were  observed  to  provide  an  explanation  of  the  decrease  in  crop  height  and  density.  Few noxious weeds are present, which will be managed by normal farming operations.",Monitor in 2015,,,
SE 6-54-14,cropland (harvested),No issues observed,1+510,Some  wood  was  found  on  ROW  likely  buried  and  brought  up  during  construction.  Larger  pieces were removed at the time of field work.,Monitor in 2015,,,
SW 5-54-14,cropland,No issues observed,1+825,No issues. Crop is comparable to the Control.,None,,,

SW 5-54-14,Watercourse (unnamed tributary to Vermillion River) / wetland,Noxious weed issue (moderate),2+470 to 2+540,"Noxious  weeds  are  present  (Canada  thistle  and  perennial  sow  thistle).  The  noxious  weeds  off ROW are more severe than on the ROW. There is a moderate cover of noxious weeds currently on the ROW. (see Appendix B condition location KP 2+470 and KP 2+540) Erosion  control  measures  are  functional.  There  is  no  evidence  of  erosion  or  subsidence  on  hill slopes.  Some  rutting  (unrelated  to  construction  activities)  was  observed,  but  repairing  the  rutting  would cause  more  disturbance  and  potential  damage than  has  already  occurred.
