(a) fill/backfill instability,Entire route,The right-of-way was recontoured to restore the preconstruction • grades. Salvaged strippings were replaced evenly over the entire cleared area to preconstruction depth. Backfilling (shading) of the pipe and backfill were kept as close • as possible to lowering-in activities. Shading was closely monitored to ensure that no hard and or • frozen clumps of dirt or rock were left on top the pipe which could cause indentations to the pipe upon completion of backfilling. No issues were noted during the 2008 PCM. •,Unresolved,Continue monitoring for trench subsidence and for excessive crown loss causing altered drainage patterns and recontour where necessary.,1. PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT,,
(a) strippings and subsoil mixing,Entire route,"Snow and duff remaining after grubbing, piling and burning were • split and windrowed to both sides of the right-of-way. 30% went to the spoil side while the remainder went to the work side of the right-of-way. The 30% stored on the spoil side left enough material to bring back as a snow roach over ditch line once the topsoil was stripped to reduce the degree of frost penetration. An area 5 m wide centered on the trench line was stripped under • frozen conditions. All strippings were windrowed along the work side of the right-of-• way. Excavated trench material was stored on the frozen snow-• covered spoil side of the right-of-way. Slight profile admixing was observed at KP 1.0, KP 1.1, KP 1.2, • KP 1.5, KP 2.0 and KP 3.9 during the 2008 PCM.",Unresolved,"Continue monitoring the re-establishment of ground cover, soil erosion potential and weed growth at KP 1.0, KP 1.1, KP 1.2, KP 1.5, KP 2.0 and KP 3.9. Rototill and seed a landowner approved cover crop to encourage surface water retention, increase soil moisture and facilitate seed establishment, if warranted.",2. SOIL CAPABILITY,,
(b) soil erosion,Entire route,"A non-native BC Forestry mixture was applied along the BC • portion of the pipeline route, while a fall rye cover crop was applied along the Alberta portion of the pipeline route. Few areas of poor growth were noted during the 2008 PCM and • vegetation establishment generally appears successful along the right-of-way.",Unresolved,"Continue monitoring vegetation establishment and soil erosion potential at KP 1.0, KP 1.1, KP 1.2, KP 1.5, KP 2.0 and KP 3.9.",2. SOIL CAPABILITY,,
(c) compaction and rutting,"Entire route and log decks at KP 1.5, KP 2.5, KP 3.5 and KP 5.3","The right-of-way was dragged with a drag of tires in an effort to • freeze down the work side. Traffic was discouraged from the right-of-way by cordoning off the work site to allow the right-of-way to set up. Swap mats and corduroy were installed at wet, peaty areas • along the pipeline route. No issues were noted during the 2008 PCM. •",Resolved,N/A,2. SOIL CAPABILITY,,

(a) loss of wetland habitat and loss or reduction of hydrological function (filtration),Entire route,"Construction occurred during frozen ground conditions. • Grubbing occurred along the right-of-way to within 2 m of either • edge of the right-of-way. The right-of-way was recontoured to restore the preconstruction • grades and drainage contours. During the 2008 PCM, low-lying areas along the right-of-way • were observed to be consistent with preconstruction drainage contours. Wetland vegetation was noted as slow to establish likely due to observed profile admixing at KP 1.0, KP 1.1, KP 1.2, KP 1.5, KP 2.0 and KP 3.9.",Unresolved,"Continue monitoring the re-establishment of ground cover, soil erosion potential and weed growth at KP 1.0, KP 1.1, KP 1.2, KP 1.5, KP 2.0 and KP 3.9.",4.

(b) loss of medicinal plants and/or berry bushes,Entire route,Construction occurred during frozen ground conditions. • Grubbing occurred along the right-of-way to within 2 m of either • edge of the right-of-way. Few native colonizers were observed along the right-of-way • during the 2008 PCM since the right-of-way was seeded with a non-native seed mix and agronomic cover crop.,Unresolved,"Continue monitoring the establishment of native vegetation along the entire right-of-way. Control trees and shrubs, if necessary, to facilitate pipeline surveillance, by mechanical rather than chemical means.",5. VEGETATION,,
(c) weed introduction and spread,Entire route,All equipment arrived on the right-of-way in a clean condition and • no equipment was turned back due to arriving in a dirty condition. •  Weed control chemicals were not to be used within 100 m of TLU Site #2 (KP 1.2). Dandelion and perennial sow-thistle were observed at trace • densities at KP 0.4 during the 2008 PCM. Narrow-leaved hawk's-beard was observed at trace densities at • KP 0.4 and KP 4.9 during the 2008 PCM. Scentless chamomile was observed at trace densities at KP 1.5 • and KP 2.5 during the 2008 PCM. Stinkweed was observed at trace densities at KP 2.5 during the • 2008 PCM.,Unresolved,Hand pull scentless chamomile at KP 1.5 and KP 2.5. Continue monitoring right-of-way for weed problem areas.,5.
