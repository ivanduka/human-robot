Remove and dispose of construction supplies appropriately.,ADrainage has stabilized and re-v egetated.  No further issues w ere noted at the site. ll construction and other debris has been remov ed from the right-of-w ay (for the entire route),1. PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT,,
(b)     Contouring and drainage,Various,"Surface contouring does not match adjacent or • preconstruction grade, or contouring is adversely affecting drainage at KP 0.43, KP 1.16, KP 2.30, KP 3.25 and KP 23.49.","Unresolved  Monitor in 2015 and re-contour, if",w arranted.,Issues relating to surface contouring and drainage hav e been addressed in Table 1.  Considerable re-contouring w as completed at KP 23.490 to address landow ner and drainage issues (see Photos 21 and 21a in Section 5.4).,1. PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT,,
(a)     Strippings/subsoil admix ing,--,No areas of admix ing were observed along the right-of-• w ay in 2013.,Resolv ed,<s>None required.</s>,<s>No concerns noted.</s>,2. SOIL AND SOIL PRODUCTIVITY,,
(b)     Degradation of soil structure and low ering of soil productiv ity through compaction and rutting,Various,"Rutting observ ed from KP 0.00 to 0.67, KP 1.27, KP • 7.04 and KP 7.15.",Unresolved,"Monitor in 2015 and repair rutting, if w arranted.",Rutting w as repaired in several areas where the potential for erosion or impacts to w ater quality  or flow  w ere present (see Table 1 for details and also see Photos 15 and 15a in Section 5.4).,2. SOIL AND SOIL PRODUCTIVITY,,
(c)     Soil erosion,Various,"Erosion channels, rills and gullies, observed on the • Pipeline right-of-w ay at KP 0.77, KP 2.40, KP 6.45, KP 6.76, KP 7.08, KP 13.61, KP 23.73, KP 23.90 and KP 24.05.",Unresolved,"Monitor in 2015 for v egetation establishment and soil erosion potential at locations listed and repair, if w arranted.","Vegetation establishment has been good to ex tensiv e throughout  most  of the line  and  the potential for further erosion has been minimized or eliminated  in  most  areas.    Erosion  repairs  w ere completed at sev eral locations w here the potential for  further  erosion  or  impacts  to  w ater  quality   or flow  w ere present (see Table 1 for details and also see Photos 13 and 13a, and 17 and 17a in Section 5.4).",2. SOIL AND SOIL PRODUCTIVITY,,
(d)     Trench subsidence,Various,Subsidence observed from KP 0.70 to KP 0.81 and • at KP 7.88.,Unresolved,Repair trench subsidence in 2014 and monitor in 2015.,Concerns regarding trench subsidence were not noted in the 2015 assessment.  Subsidence at a bellhole at KP 3.540 w as observed and was repaired as noted in Table 1 (see Photos 16 and 16a in Section 5.4).,2. SOIL AND SOIL PRODUCTIVITY,,
(b)     Trench crown,Various,Trench crown (0.5 m high) observed from KP 0.00 to KP • 0.67 affecting cross right-of- w ay drainage.,Unresolved,"Install breaks in the trench crown in 2014, if w arranted, and monitor in 2015 to ensure trench crow n doesn’t affect cross right-of-way drainage.",There are adequate breaks in the trench crown to avoid w ater blockage or damning issues.  It is not causing drainage or ponding concerns as noted in Table 1.  This is a v ery wet area and any efforts to remove the crown at this time w ould result in significant environmental impacts for low  return.,2. SOIL AND SOIL PRODUCTIVITY,,
(a)     Alterations of natural flow  patterns,Various,Surface contouring has the potential to alter natural • flow  patterns. See1.(b). Subsidence has the potential to alter natural flow  • patterns. See 2.(b) Trench Subsidence.,Unresolved,See 1.(d) Contouring and 2.(d) Trench Subsidence.,Items 1.(b) Contouring and Drainage and 2 (d) Trench Subsidence have been addressed above and are noted in Table 1 as appropriate.,3. WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY,,
(a)     Loss of w etland habitat and loss or reduction of hy drological function (filtration),Various,Moderate v egetation establishment at KP 7.02 and KP • 7.08.,Unresolved  Monitor v egetation establishment and,erosion in 2015 as w arranted.,Ex tensiv e vegetation is now  present through most low-ly ing areas.  Where v egetation w as not y et up to standard re-v egetation measures were employed as per Table 1.,4. WETLANDS,,
(a)     Loss or alteration of nativ e v egetation and v egetation important to w ildlife,Various,"Poor v egetation establishment observed from KP 0.77 • to KP 1.39, KP 9.32 to KP 9.57 and at KP 13.82.",Unresolved,Monitor v egetation establishment in 2015.,"Vegetation establishment has been dealt w ith ov er the entire route.  In general, v egetation re-establishment has been good to ex tensive on the line.  Areas w here re-vegetation w as poor or lacking (as identified in the 2015 Spring Inspection) hav e been re-treated using a v ariety  of means as documented in Table 1 (see Photos 14 and 14a, 18 and 18a, 19 and 19a, and 20 and 20a in Section 5.4).",5. VEGETATION,,
(b)     Weed introduction and spread,Various,"Weedy  species observed at densities of concern at KP • 2.26, KP 10.58 and KP 11.88.",Unresolved  Control and/or monitor v egetation,establishment in 2015.,"Concerns regarding w eed growth hav e been addressed in Table 1.  Vegetation establishment has resolv ed most weed concerns however, tw o areas of concern are noted in Table 1.",5. VEGETATION,,
