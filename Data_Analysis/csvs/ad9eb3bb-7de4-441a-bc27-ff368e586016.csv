Rutting,KP 518.05 to KP 518.2,--  Loss of soil structure occurred as a result of wet soils handling during early spring clean-up on irrigated lands. -  Control weeds in summer 2001; reseed if necessary. Good growth noted in summer 2001.,Resolved,-,1. LOSS OF AGRICULTURAL CAPABILITY,,

Area very dry in 2001; growth poor to OK with some weeds, but expected to be fine with adequate rainfall",Resolved,PLM to monitor revegetation in 2002,1. LOSS OF AGRICULTURAL CAPABILITY,,
Weed proliferation,KP 504.2 to KP 508.0; KP 519.9;  KP 624.0 to KP 625.7,--  May require reseeding and weed control.   KP 504.2 to KP 504.5; Poor seed catch and excessive weed growth.  Cultivated and reseeded fall 2001. -  KP 504.5 to KP 508.0; east side of river reseeded and straw crimped in 2000.  Good establishment. -  KP 519.9; Weeds were sprayed in 2000. Grass growth good and weed growth dwindling. -  KP 624.0 to KP 625.7; Growth poor due to dry conditions. Seed rows visible but very weedy.,Resolved,"PLM to monitor revegetation in 2002 from KP 504.2 to KP 504.5 and from KP 624.0 to KP 625.7  Weed control and reseeding, if required, will be conducted on a site-specific basis",1. LOSS OF AGRICULTURAL CAPABILITY,,
,KP 509.8 to KP 510.4; KP 556.5 to KP 558.0; KP 559.5 to KP 566.5; KP 575.0 to KP 576.5;  KP 627.0 to KP 628.0,"--  May require weed control during the 2001 growing season.   KP 509.8 to KP 510.4; Growth much better in 2001. Bare spots in field caused by salinity from old irrigation ditch. -  KP 556.5 to KP 558.0, KP 559.5 to KP 566.5, KP 575.0 to KP 576.5 and KP 627.0 to KP 628.0; Grass growth OK, but some weeds. Very dry conditions.",Resolved,"PLM to monitor revegetation in 2002 from KP 556.5 to KP 558.0, KP 559.5 to KP 566.5, KP 575.0 to KP 576.5 and KP 627.0 to KP 628.0  Weed control and reseeding, if required, will be conducted on a site-specific basis",1. LOSS OF AGRICULTURAL CAPABILITY,,
Visible crop growth suppression,KP 362.0; KP 377; KP 380.5;  KP 392.0 to KP 393.0; KP 415.7; KP 433.1,"--  Suppressed crop growth noted during aerial and ground reconnaissance.  Compaction tests during summer 2000 post-construction monitoring indicated no differences on and off right-of-way.  Possibly caused by moisture deficiency in spring.   KP 362.0; Regrading done in the last 12 months. Likely moisture deficient in spring. -  KP 377.0; Area regraded in the fall 1999 followed by very dry conditions, resulting in poor germination. -  KP 380.5; Regrading done in the last 12 months. Likely moisture deficient in spring. -  KP 392.0 to KP 393.0; Adequate growth noted. -  KP 415.7 and KP 433.1; Right-of-way was disturbed and grade was lowered in fall 2000. Poor moisture in spring caused poor germination.  No issues at Eagle Creek.",Resolved,PLM to visually monitor crop growth at all locations in 2002  Soil and moisture conditions will be assessed if crop growth problems persist,1. LOSS OF AGRICULTURAL CAPABILITY,,
Wind and water erosion on moderately steep slopes,Sandy textured soils on the east side of the South Saskatchewan River,"-  Spoil and topsoil piles for the excavation were tackified with ER 2000 in the early winter of 1998.   -  Several measures including the installation of COIR fabric, slash rollback, silt fences and staked straw bales were used to control erosion on the small coulee encountered on the east approach slope. -  Temporary erosion control berms were installed on the disturbed portion of the slope and permanent berms were installed during final clean-up. -  Areas on the east site with a disturbed sod layer were seeded with a native mix and cover crop and then straw crimped. -  The erosion control measures implemented following construction were successful in controlling erosion.  However, dry conditions resulted in poor establishment of reclamation grasses.  Re-seeding and straw crimping was conducted in the summer of 2000. -  East side of river reseeded and straw crimped in 2000.  Good establishment but heavily grazed.",Resolved,-,2. EROSION,,
Loss of rare plants,KP 394.5,-  Few-flowered aster -  Transplanted 5 individuals utilizing hand methods. Transplanted 15 individuals utilizing backhoe. -  Plant not located during the summer 2000 post-construction monitoring program. -  Rare plant located on both sides of the right-of-way in 2001.,Resolved,-,5. VEGETATION,,
,KP 561.8,-  Seed gathered from few-flowered aster.  Stored at Kerrobert Station. -  Plant not located during the summer 2000 post-construction monitoring program.-  Rare plant seed not yet returned to the right-of-way.,Resolved,"Enbridge will ensure seed is planted in 2002, after stratifying PLM will monitor survival in subsequent years",5. VEGETATION,,
Disturbance of ranching,KP 509.8 to KP 510.4,--  May require weed control during the 2001 growing season.   KP 509.8 to KP 510.4; Growth much better in 2001. Bare spots in field caused by salinity from old irrigation ditch.,Resolved,-,6. LAND USE,,
