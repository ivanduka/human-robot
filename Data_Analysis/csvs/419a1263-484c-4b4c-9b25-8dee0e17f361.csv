Rutting,KP 1109.9 to KP 1110.0,Various soils handling methods were used to minimize the risk of rutting.  Rutting did occur at these locations and substantial grading to remove the shallow ruts was necessary.  Some loss of soil structure is anticipated. -  soil mixing was evident du,Resolved,PLM personnel to monitor crop and revegetation success in 2002,1. LOSS OF AGRICULTURAL CAPABILITY,,
Weed proliferation,KP 1003.0; KP 1160.5 to KP 1161.3; KP 1195.9,- Little vegetation cover was evident during summer 2000 post-construction monitoring -  Reseeding may be required.   KP 1003.0; Very weedy by road. PLM cut weeds fall 2001 and will monitor in 2002. -  KP 1160.5 to KP 1161.3; Low wet area of field; may re,Resolved,PLM personnel to monitor revegetation success in 2002 and reseed or control weeds as necessary,1. LOSS OF AGRICULTURAL CAPABILITY,,
Weed proliferation,Noncultivated segments reseeded in 2000,-  Noncultivated areas at the following locations were reseeded in the fall of 2000 because of poor vegetation reestablishment: KP 1126.9 to KP 1127.2; KP 1128.2 to KP 1128.9.   Newly seeded: PLM will monitor in spring 2002,Resolved,PLM personnel to monitor revegetation success in 2002,1. LOSS OF AGRICULTURAL CAPABILITY,,
,KP 1190.0 to KP 1192.6; KP 1072.2 to KP 1074.0,--  May require reseeding and weed control.   KP 1190.0 to 1192.6; Leafy spurge very prevalent on right-of-way and off.  Area has been sprayed twice this year.  PLM will monitor in spring 2002. -  KP 1072.2 to KP 1074.0; Leafy spurge noted on right-of-way. Leafy spurge has been cut once this year and will be sprayed in spring 2002.,Resolved,"PLM will monitor right-of-way for leafy spurge 2002 and take remedial measures, as required.",,,
Bank stability or approach slope erosion,KP 1073.8 to KP 1074.0,--  Minor rill erosion on the east approach slope to the Souris River was repaired in the fall of 2000.   Slope is stable with no signs of erosion.,Resolved,-,2.  WATER CROSSINGS,,
Loss of rare plants,KP 1004.4 to KP 1004.9,"--  Right-of-way preparation activi-ties resulted in a disturbance of large stands of sand bluestem. -  No sand bluestem seed was available from the right-of-way due to heavy grazing, however, seed was collected from adjacent areas and sown during final clean-up on adjacent areas (KP 1004.9 to KP 1005.1). -  A few individuals found on the right-of-way during summer 2000 post-construction monito-ring, but not at the locations where seed was sown.   Bluestem found on the old right-of-way and on the road ditch, but not on the new right-of-way; also found sand nutgrass (rare plant) at the site.",Resolved,-,3. VEGETATION,,
,KP 1006.4,"--  About 30 seneca root (uncommon, not rare) plants were salvaged and transplanted 200 m NW of the right-of-way.  Another 50 plants were salvaged and transplanted in a nursery.  Seeds were collected and sown on the right-of-way.  About 25 plants remained on the work side but were protected under the topsoil windrow. -  Transplant site not located and no plants found on the right-of-way, during the summer 2000 post-construction monitoring.   Transplant site could not be located and no plants found on the right-of-way in summer 2001.",Resolved,-,,,
Salt water pipeline leak,KP 993.2,"--  A salt water pipeline leak occurred in October of 1998.  Vacuum trucks were brought in to remove as much salt water as feasible.  Water samples in August 1999 indicated that high salt levels were still present and vacuum trucks hauled all remaining water to a nearby disposal well. -  Soil sample results indicated that elevated salt levels were present in the immediate vicinity of the bell hole while salt levels on adjacent areas were likely not problematic.  A groundwater monitoring well was installed at the site. -  While no crop growth problems were evident during summer 2000 post-construction monitoring, the results of soil samples taken in the summer of 2000 indicate that salts from the spill continue to impact the site.    Long term mitigation and monitoring to reclaim this site is ongoing.",Resolved,PLM to continue mitigation and <s>monitoring program</s>,"4. CONTAMINATION OF GROUNDWATER, SURFACE WATER AND SOILS",,
