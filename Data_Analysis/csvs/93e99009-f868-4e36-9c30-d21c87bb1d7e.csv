(a) Slope and fill stability,Entire route,The right-of-way was recontoured to restore the ? preconstruction grades and drainage channels along the remainder of the pipeline route. 8 m long scalped area observed along south boundary of ? right-of-way at inspection site 2.,Resolved,Scalped area appears to be leveling out by natural processes. Continue to monitor the reconstructed profile during normal Operations and Maintenance activities.,1. PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT,,
(a) Strippings / subsoil mixing,Entire route,Strippings were replaced over the stripped areas along the ? pipeline route. Unspread strippings were observed along the south side of ? the right-of-way at inspection site 3. Poorly-mixed and graded trench crown from inspection site 2 ? to 3.,Resolved,Revegetation and leveling occurring along bare areas from inspection site 2 to 3. Continue to monitor the re-establishment of ground cover during normal Operations and Maintenance activities.,2. SOIL CAPABILITY,,
(b) Trench subsidence and crowning,Entire route,A slight crown was left over the trench to compensate for ? settlement along the majority of the route. Excess crowning was observed along a segment near ? inspection site 1.,Resolved,Excess crown appears to be settling within the trench line. Continue to monitor for trench settlement during normal Operations and Maintenance activities.,2. SOIL CAPABILITY,,
(a) Alterations of natural flow patterns,Entire route,"The right-of-way and log deck sites were recontoured to ? restore the preconstruction grades and drainage channels.  Breaks were left in the crown at obvious drainages and areas ? where seepage occurs in order to minimize interference with natural drainage, and at sidehill locations along the right-of-way. All corduroy and geotextile matting along the right-of-way was ? removed post-construction in order to avoid interfering with natural drainage patterns and ensure adequate cross drainage across right-of-way.",Resolved,Continue to monitor for trench settlement during normal Operations and Maintenance activities.,3. WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY,,
(a) Weed introduction,Entire route,No weeds of concern were identified during the PCM program. ?,Resolved,Continue to monitor for weed growth and introduction during normal Operations and Maintenance activities.,4. VEGETATION,,
(a) Loss of vascular plant species at risk or significant vascular plant communities,KP 4.7,"A Vegetation Assessment (TERA 2006) was undertaken ? along the pipeline route on August 29 and 30, 2006. One listed rare plant species, golden saxifrage (Chrysosplenium iowense) (S2S3), was observed during the survey. The area was fenced off prior to clearing and willows in the ? area were not cleared. The rare plant enclosure fencing and willows were stable at ? the time of the 2007 PCM, although golden saxifrage was not observed within the enclosure (inspection site 15). Impatiens sp. was observed at moderate densities from ? inspection site 13 to 14. Since a rare touch-me-not species, orange touch-me-not (Impatiens aurella) (S2S3), was discovered in this area previously (TERA 2006), and since these plants were lacking features necessary for identification, it cannot be discounted that these plants may be the rare species.",Resolved,Impatiens sp. was not identified along the right-of-way in 2008. Removal of the rare plant enclosure at inspection site 15 is recommended.,5. SPECIES AT RISK,,
