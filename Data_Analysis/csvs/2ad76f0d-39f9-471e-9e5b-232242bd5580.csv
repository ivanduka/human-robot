SW 35-79-14,Cultivated,--,Poor vegetation establishment,"2014: From KP 0.0 to KP 0.04 area is rough and was not seeded (Plates 1 and 2, Appendix C). This issue is located next to a field entrance and was not observed during previous monitoring years. The rough, unseeded area is present only on the pipeline right-of-way running perpendicular to the Project. It does not appear that this issue is associated with the Project right-of-way.",--,Resolved.,None.,,,

Monitor vegetation this summer and haul in topsoil to complete repairs.  014: Poor vegetation establishment, 15 cm subsidence and increased weeds, including foxtail barley, Canada thistle and wild oats observed from KP 1.29 to KP 1.46 (Plate 3, Appendix C).","2012: Disked right-of-way where vegetation was poor and planned to haul in topsoil to repair settled areas, however, early snowfall delayed plans until 2013. 2013: Re-worked right-of-way with tractor and disc, hauled in topsoil to fill subsidence, re-contoured drainage, prepared right-of-way for reseeding and seeded right-of-way. Germination was poor in some spots and good in others. Landowner sprayed for noxious/nuisance weeds. ARC monitored the right-of-way.",Unresolved.,ARC will disk areas of poor vegetation and re-seed. Topsoil will be hauled in to fill subsided tie-in edges and the right-of-way will be sprayed for noxious and nuisance weeds. Area will be re-assessed in 2015.,,,
SW 5-80-13,Cultivated,Compaction,Poor vegetation establishment,2222010: Fewer plants on right-of-way compared to off right-of-way stem density at KP 6.3. 011: Poor crop establishment at KP 6.3. 012: Areas of poor growth unresolved. Monitor vegetation this summer.  014: No compaction or vegetation-related issues observed. Crop appeared healthy and no signs of compaction were observed. This issue was likely resolved by repeated freeze/thaw cycles and by repeated tillage during farming operations.,2012: ARC monitored vegetation: vegetation growth increased and compaction decreased due to climatic conditions (freeze & thaw) and good farming practices.,Resolved.,None.,,,
SW 5-80-13,Cultivated,Subsidence,--,"2014: Subsidence observed at KP 6.28, 18 m x 5 m x 30 cm deep (Plate 4, Appendix C).",--,Unresolved.,ARC will haul in topsoil to fill the 18 m long subsided erosion rill. Area will be re-assessed in 2015.,,,

Rill erosion observed on right-of-way at KP 7.5 to KP 7.6 and KP 8.2. 012: Some erosion damage due to heavy rains last summer. The berm between the municipal road ditch and the field will be repaired in May 2012 to prevent runoff from the road ditch into the field. Haul in topsoil to repair erosion.   014: The ditch at the field edge at KP 7.38 is not high enough and is resulting in some gully erosion as water travels over the ditch edge. The height of the ditch needs to be increased to assist in reducing erosion issues. Weeds, including Canada thistle, are present in this area (Plate 5, Appendix C). atural drainage is located at KP 7.56, 40 cm wide x 15 m long x 8 cm deep on the right-of-way. Drainages similar to this were also observed off the right-of-way across the field (Plate 6, Appendix C) and this is, therefore, not considered an issue.  ubsidence 80 m long x 25 cm wide x 4 cm deep observed over trench line at KP 8.17. This depression extends into the field to the north and terminates at a wetland (Plate 8, Appendix C).","22012: Hauled in clay fill, built up berm between municipal road and field edge. Hauled in topsoil to fill the erosion rills caused by run-off. 014: Hauled in clay fill and built-up berm between municipal road and field edge. Planned to haul in topsoil to fill subsidence, however, landowner was unable to harvest the canola swaths due to wet weather conditions.",Unresolved.,"ARC will haul in topsoil or redistribute existing topsoil to fill subsidence at KP 8.17. The road berm will be monitored in 2015 to ensure run-off water does not affect the right-of-way. Rill erosion will be repaired by redistributing topsoil or hauling topsoil in. ARC may also re-contour drainages, if warranted, to help prevent further erosion issues. Weed controls will be discussed and the right-of-way will be monitored in 2015.",,,

Moderate compaction throughout entire quarter on right-of-way. 011: Rill erosion observed on right-of-way at KP 8.3. Compaction observed at KP 8.3 to KP 8.5 and KP 8.9 to KP 9.05.  012: Areas of compaction and poor vegetation growth unresolved. Monitor vegetation this summer and address compaction. The 2011 erosion issue was likely resolved by repeated tillage during farming operations.,--,Resolved.,None.,,,

Haul in topsoil to repair.  014: A trench is present at the field line, which was filled in during pipeline construction. This trench is causing runoff into the field resulting in rill erosion. A subsidence issue 10 m long x 40 cm wide x 30 cm deep was also observed at KP 8.26. Weeds, including Canada thistle and wild oats, were observed in the field line in this area, however, weed densities are similar off right-of-way and, therefore, this is not considered a weed issue (Plate 9, Appendix C).",--,Unresolved.,"ARC will re-contour the drainage that runs between the NE and SE 1/4 section, fill the erosion rill with topsoil and re-contour the low areas for better drainage.

Crop cut prior to conducting 2010 survey. 011: No land access granted at time of survey. 012: Areas of admixing and compaction unresolved. Address compaction and haul in topsoil to repair.   014: Shovel tests conducted at various points along the right-of-way indicate soil consistency and admixing to be equal on and off the right-of-way.

Crop had been harvested prior to assessment so crop heights could not be compared, however, density and health of stubble appeared the same on and off the right-of-way. No subsidence issues observed.  5-10 cm high pile of soil was observed from KP 12.04 to KP 12.23. This was identified as additional replacement topsoil that was not spread in fall 2014 (Plate 13, Appendix C). Issue is not causing any drainage concerns.",2012: Hauled in topsoil to fill the subsided ditchline at several locations within the NW 15. Did not spread last load of topsoil as weather became too wet.
