NE 31-56-21,0.1,Moderate Vegetation Establishment,Ungulate tracking at the edge of the berm at KP 0.3 has reduced the vegetation establishment in this area (see Plate 3). Vegetation cover is expected to improve in subsequent years.,Monitor vegetation establishment in 2014.,,,
NE 31-56-21,0.1,Erosion,"Minor rill erosion was observed over the trench line at KP 0.5. This is the steepest portion of the slope and a berm is effectively diverting overland flow. Seedlings are present in the area, which will reduce erosion as they establish (see Plate 4).","Monitor in 2014 for vegetation establishment and a reduction in erosion. If warranted, implement further erosion control measures in 2014.",,,
