Off ROW vegetation successfully establishing on ROW; species biodiversity maintained. No net loss of wetland function was observed.","July 27, 2018 - Treed Fen adjacent to the compressor station appears to be at baseline (pre-construction) conditions with no net loss of wetland function observed. Proper wetland functionality has been attained.  - Vegetation establishment throughout wetland is at 80-100% cover compared with control.  - Vegetation throughout wetland consisting of graminoids (sedges, rushes & grasses), common cattail, willows and sphagnum mosses. Good establishment of hydrophytic vegetation including pondweed and vernal water starwort. - No noxious weeds were identified within wetland. - Hydrology has been maintained across disturbed area. No issues of hydrologic connectivity were noted. - Substrate appears healthy throughout wetland through uniform distribution of vegetation, hydrological conditions and organics. High humification occurring in wetland both throughout disturbed and off disturbed portions. Substrate samples showed high organic accumulation with some peat accumulation. Depth of peat was undetermined due to the saturation of the substrate. - Substrate within wetland exhibiting fully-saturated conditions with the water table residing at the ground surface. There is a slight channelized flow to the northwest into the mixedwood treed swamp. - Wetland providing good habitat opportunities through good vegetation cover, snags and standing water. High amphibian activity observed within wetland. - Wetland has achieved pre-construction contours with no ponding or erosion issues throughout. Vegetation biodiversity has been attained across the wetland. Coniferous and deciduous trees will continue to infill over time.",,,
,Treed Fen (along access trail) Weeds,- Trace densities of scentless chamomile observed on the west and east side of the access road footprint.,"July 20, 2016 – scentless chamomile is no longer evident, issue resolved.","July 21, 2017 – Scentless chamomile identified on south side of compressor site. Recommend herbicide application. July 28, 2017 – Intermittent herbicide application conducted to control scentless chamomile on the south side of compressor station. August 17, 2017 - No sign of scentless chamomile observed south of compressor station. Issue resolved.","July 27, 2018 - Single scentless chamomile present to the west of the compressor station. - No scentless chamomile was identified to the south of the compressor station as previously identified; issue resolved. August 9, 2018 – Herbicide application conducted to control scentless chamomile at one spot along access.",,,
,Mixedwood Treed Swamp (along access trail) Low/Moderate Vegetation Establishment,"- Mixedwood treed swamp adjacent to access road footprint appears to be functioning appropriately.
