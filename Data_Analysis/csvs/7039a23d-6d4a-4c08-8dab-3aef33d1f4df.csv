SW 11-14-6 W4,pasture,Vegetation Cover (moderate),"Vegetation  cover  within the reclaimed  portion  of the Project footprint (outside  of the  permanently fenced facility) is 65 – 80 % compared to the representative site conditions.  This includes the topsoil piles on the north and south sides of the facility.  The growth is consistent with the expected cover in the first growing season, continued monitoring recommended to ensure the reclaimed portion of the Project footprint continues on a positive trajectory.",Monitor in 2018,,,
SW 11-14-6 W4,pasture,Vegetation – Planted Trees (none),"Rows  of  caragana  have  been  planted  on  the  north  and south sides of the facility as well as in two rows on each of the topsoil  piles (completed  at  Landowner request).  Plantings appeared to be in good condition, although the assessment  was  completed  late  in  the  growing  season.  Continued monitoring recommended to ensure success of caragana plantings.",Monitor in 2018,,,
SW 11-14-6 W4,pasture,Vegetation – Weeds (moderate),"There  were  no  noxious  or  prohibited  noxious  weeds encountered during the  PCM assessment. Invasive species (kochia and sweet clover) were present in higher percentages  on the reclaimed  portion  of the  Project footprint (surrounding the facility, on the north side of the topsoil pile to the south of the facility, and along the access road) than off.  The plants were dormant at the time of the assessment  and  no  remediation  was  recommended  for the fall of 2017.  Recommend monitoring of the site in 2018 and  the  implementation  of  weed  control  measures,  as required. Note:  Invasive  species,  including  kochia,  sweet  clover, and other species, are present in the nearby county road ditches,  therefore  complete  eradication  of  weeds  within the  Project footprint is  unlikely to  be  attainable.  The presence of weeds is not expected to interfere with land use.","Monitor in 2018, implement weed control, as required.",,,
SW 11-14-6 W4,pasture,Landscape (none),"Overall  the  disturbed  area  surrounding  the  permanently fenced facility is in good condition with contours consistent with  a transition  between the fenced facility  and the surrounding pasture (drainage ditch surrounds the outside perimeter of the fenced facility).  There was no erosion or subsidence noted. The  newly  constructed  access  road  is  in  good  condition with  nicely  contoured  ditches.    There  was  no  erosion  or subsidence noted. Two topsoil piles are present, one on the north, one on the south, side of the facility.  The piles are well contoured with no  stability  issues  noted.    They  are  fenced  off  from  the surrounding pasture.",None,,,
SW 11-14-6 W4,pasture,Construction Debris  (none),Two  large  steel  posts  and  gate  were  present  near  the access road.  The Landowner has chosen to retain these materials  and  will  remove them  at their  convenience.  Issue resolved.,None,,,
