The values provided are spatial maxima over all land-based  receptors. Concentration increases of ozone and PM2.5 are small compared to current and future  applicable standards; therefore their magnitude is rated low. No standard is applicable to visibility. A  visibility reduction of one deciview (dv) is small but noticeable in a pristine environment with very good  visibility (Colls and Tiwary 2009).

Since the night snorkel occurred only within the survey section  between the centre of the proposed pipeline corridor and 200 m downstream, study design may partially  explain the greater relative abundance of fish in the survey section nearest the centre of the proposed  pipeline corridor. During the night snorkel, approximately six times more fish were observed by the  snorkeler (n=81) than during the day (n=14) within the same reach. In addition, congregations of juvenile  (< 20 cm TL) and adult (> 30 cm TL) mountain whitefish were encountered during the night snorkel, but  were not observed during the day snorkel. It is expected that a change in fish activity between the survey  times resulted in the increased observations. Similar differences in results occurring between day and  night snorkeling surveys in Sundance Creek were also reported by Christie et al. (2010). is 0\n",

Consistent with results across the country, a  relatively high proportion of people in all regions rated their perceived mental health as “very good or  excellent”. Rates were substantially higher for the Richmond HSDA than for other areas in BC; otherwise,  the overall average varied slightly but not a great deal between regions. Similarly, a very high proportion  of people in both Alberta and BC, over 90% on average, rated life satisfaction as “satisfied or very  satisfied”. Perceived life stress refers to the perception that most days in the respondent’s life are “quite a  bit” or “extremely” stressful. Across both Alberta and BC, just over 20% of the population reported high  levels of life stress. Rates varied among regions, with the Thompson Cariboo Shuswap HSDA reporting  the lowest levels of life stress (18.7% of the population) and the Edmonton Health Zone and Fraser South  HSDA reporting the highest (over 24%). is 0\n",

The extent and frequency of disturbance in agricultural landscapes, such as in the Prairie Ecozone and,  more specifically, in the Vegetation RSA, are great enough that areas of native vegetation are likely  limited in their capacity to provide necessary ecosystem functions (see Section 6.2.9.2). While native  vegetation may regenerate in disturbed areas, long-term land use planning has identified that areas of  agricultural development are likely to continue indefinitely in the future and, therefore, disturbance of  native vegetation associated with agricultural activities (e.g., cultivation) is considered to be permanent  (irreversible). Although the biological implications of agricultural activities on native vegetation would  suggest a high magnitude effect in the Vegetation RSA, removal of native vegetation for the purpose of  agricultural activities has been incorporated in development and land use planning for the counties, MDs  and RMs in which the Project is located. For example, the MD of Provost states in its Municipal  Development Plan that agriculture is the most extensive land use in the MD. The municipality contains a  variety of agricultural operations, however, the eastern sector is generally used for field crop production  and the western sector is often used for livestock operations (MD of Provost No. 52 2004).The RM of  Lajord states in its Municipal Development Plan that the primary economic functions of the municipality  are rooted in the agricultural sector and that the majority of the land in the RM is suited to dry-land crop  farming (RM of Lajord No. 128 2012). The RM of Lorne states in its Municipal Development Plan that  highly productive agricultural lands should not be developed for non-agricultural uses, unless there is no  suitable alternative site with equal attributes capable of serving the proposed use or the development at  the selected site meets an important public need. Areas should be preserved for a full range of  agricultural activities on prime agricultural land on lower class land where agriculture is dominant activity  and where it is desirable and feasible to provide protection to such activities (South Central Planning  District 2003).Therefore, the magnitude of disturbance is considered within social and regulatory  standards (see Appendix 9 for data sources used regarding land use planning). is 0\n",

The rationale used to evaluate the significance of each of the potential  residual environmental effects is provided below. The criteria ratings and significance evaluation for the  potential residual effects are provided for all Project components in Attachment 7A (Table 7A.18). The  magnitude of the potential residual effects is determined based on the sensitivity of the receiving  environment as well as the location and size of the accident. For example, a spill caused by a fuel truck  rollover in a stream with high quality fish habitat will be of higher magnitude than if high quality fish habitat  is not present. Regarding location, a fire would have a higher magnitude if it was widespread and in a highly  populated area, for example. is 0\n",

A high proportion of the labour force is engaged in the  agriculture sector, where salaries are relatively lower compared to other sectors. This results in lower  average income in rural regions, such as in the Mauricie ($38,883), Chaudière-Appalaches (average of  $39,796), and Bas-Saint-Laurent ($36,428) regions. Income tends to be inversely related to the working  distance from urban centres. The average income in the greater Montréal area and the surrounding  regions of Montérégie and Laurentides is around $48,000.

      "Table C-5 lists the emission rates applied in dispersion modelling for the short-term (1-hour and 24-hour)  averaging periods. A peak emission scenario was developed for short-term effects analysis, which  involves five tanks (two filling and three being drawn down) assumed to be emitting at maximum emission  rate, with the remaining 17 tanks operating at minimum emission rates (standing losses only). Peak  emission rates are associated with working losses when remaining crude oil evaporates from the tank  walls, and minimum emission rates are related to breathing losses from storage tank in static operating  mode. Rates in bold represent the tank emitting at maximum rate based on the highest concentration of  component of interest in the crude type. Mercaptans rates are in methyl mercaptan equivalent. An  example calculation showing how peak benzene emissions are estimated (from tank T-4) is provided:  First, the tank fill rate is determined using the normal tank capacity and the fill duration (for T-4) as shown  in equation 1: is 0\n",

      "Figure 8-10 presents the mapped results of hydrocarbon deposition to subtidal sediment (g/m2) from the  hypothetical release. Most of the SAMAM (35,575 km2; nearly 86% of the SAMAM) is predicted to receive  a non-detectable sediment hydrocarbon loading <0.1 g/m2. An area of approximately 5,945 km2 (14.3% of  the area of the SAMAM) is conservatively estimated to receive a measureable sediment hydrocarbon  loading of ≥0.1 to <1 g/m2. Most oil deposition to sediment in this area is predicted to occur in the middle  of the Bay of Fundy, in the channel between Grand Manan and Maine, and off the coast of Maine. The  maximum predicted sediment loading value for any grid cell is estimated to be 0.41 g/m2. These  conservatively estimated loadings are very low, and would not be expected to result in adverse  environmental effects on benthic fauna. In addition, given the high shear stresses that exist on the bottom  of the Bay of Fundy, it is not likely that oil deposited to sediment would remain at the point of initial  deposition. Rather, it would move with currents and become mixed with other sediments in the near- bottom boundary layer. At such low concentrations, natural processes of dispersion and biodegradation  would likely result in negligible long-term environmental effects. is 0\n",

Relatively little intertidal habitat belonging to BSF classes 1 or 2 is  contacted by the BAK oil (less than 1%). About 5.4% of habitat in BSF class 3 would be affected, and  about 10.6% of habitat in BSF class 4 would be affected. However, it is also recognized that the marine  habitat around and south of Grand Manan is an area of high productivity, and great importance to marine  birds, and that the potential environmental effects of spilled oil in this area on marine bird populations  could be greater than a strictly area-based analysis would suggest. is 0\n",

      "Figure 7-10 presents the mapped results for hydrocarbon deposition to subtidal sediment (g/m2) resulting  from the hypothetical release. Based on these results, an area of approximately 5,136.3 km2 (12.4% of  the area of the SAMAM) is conservatively estimated to receive a measureable sediment hydrocarbon  loading of ≥0.1 to <1 g/m2. A further 115.3 km2 (0.28% of the area of the SAMAM) is expected to receive  a sediment hydrocarbon loading of ≥1 but <5 g/m2. Most oil deposition to sediment is predicted to occur in  the Bay of Fundy, south and east of Grand Manan and toward Digby Neck), with a smaller area extending  into the Gulf of Maine. Several small areas (each representing a single model grid square of less than  1 km2) of crude oil deposition ≥5 g/m2 are predicted between Grand Manan and the Digby Neck in the  Bay of Fundy, and around Machais Seal Island, with a maximum predicted deposition loading of nearly  26 g/m2 predicted near the shoreline of Digby Neck. As shown in the inset on Figure 7-10, this value  represents an average deposition value for a single grid square in the fate and transport model, an area  slightly less than 1 km2. This suggests that isolated areas of adverse effects on subtidal sediment could  occur if crude oil were to be deposited directly to the sediment. However, the estimates of crude oil  deposition to sediment are highly conservative. Even the weathered BAK crude oil has a density  substantially less than that of sea water. A much more likely scenario is that the floating oil will continue to  float and weather until it eventually strands on a shoreline. Less than 4% of the spilled oil remains on the  water surface at the end of the 30-day simulation. is 0\n",

      "Table 5-24 provides the distribution of shoreline oiling (km) for all marine terminal spills for both warmer  and colder seasons. The frequency mapping for shoreline oiling is shown in Figures 5-7 and 5-8 for  warmer and colder seasons. When split into the two seasons, the average length of shoreline contacted  by individual spills within the stochastic set varied from 70 km (colder season) to 88 km (warmer season),  while the average oil deposition on shorelines is greater in the colder season (0.32 L/m2) than in the  warmer season (0.28 L/m2). When split by season, no shoreline oiling is predicted by the stochastic  modelling for any annual frequency greater than 10-3 (1 in 1,000 years). During the warmer season, an  estimated 255 km of shoreline is exposed to a risk of oiling at a frequency range of 10-3 to 10-4 per year.  This compares with 176 km during the colder season, and reflects seasonal wind patterns that tend to  favour oil being retained near the New Brunswick coastline during warmer season, whereas it is more  likely to be swept towards the Nova Scotia coastline during the colder season. Statistics for the lower  oiling frequency bands (10-4 to 10-5 and 10-5 to 10-6 per year) are generally similar, particularly in light of  the low likelihood of such exposure to oiling. is 0\n",

On days 5 and 10, the surface oil slick remains somewhat  confined, close to the New Brunswick shoreline, and is generally ≥2 µm thick. Subsequently, the slick  moves offshore and begins to disperse, affecting areas around Grand Manan, and then moves out into  the Gulf of Maine as predominantly very thin slicks in offshore areas.

      "Figure 6-2 shows the mass balance information for the fate of the simulated spill of WCS crude oil in  Saint John Harbour. Of the total volume of 10,595 m3 assumed to be spilled, less than 20% is estimated  to be lost to evaporation, and most of this loss occurs in the first 2 days following the release. Very little  evaporation is predicted to occur after the first 5 days. Over the first 10 days, a substantial amount (about  70%) of the spilled oil comes ashore and strands on shorelines. This is reflected by heavy oiling of  shorelines along the mainland New Brunswick coastline up until about day 10, with substantially lighter  oiling of shorelines around Grand Manan and along the north coast of Maine after that time. A relatively  small amount of the spilled oil (about 6%) dissolves in the water column, and this too occurs primarily in  the first 10 days following the spill. About 3.5% of the spilled oil is lost to biodegradation in the first  30 days, most of which is predicted to occur in the first 5 to 10 days following the spill. As a result of these  processes, the total quantity of spilled oil remaining on the water surface declines rapidly over the first  10 days, so that only about 5% remains on the water surface after 10 days. The spilled oil is not predicted  to weather to a density greater than that of seawater during the first 30 days, so the diluted bitumen is not  predicted to sink as a result of weathering. No oil is predicted to leave the model domain within the first  30 days of the simulation. is 0\n",

The drawings also show the areas of  shoreline that have been exposed to oiling. On day 5, the surface oil slick remains somewhat confined to  the north of the modelled spill location, with smaller areas of water covered with oil south of Grand  Manan. At this time, the spill is made up of an almost equal split of slicks <2 µm thickness and ≥2 µm  thickness. By day 10, a number of distinct slicks have formed in the Bay of Fundy, with slicks of ≥2 µm  thickness north of the spill location, and light slicks remaining south of Grand Manan. Oiling of the  southern and western shorelines of Grand Manan has also occurred, with some shoreline oiling also  occurring in Maine and near the tip of Digby Neck. By day 15, oil has reached the shoreline of Nova  Scotia (the north side of Digby Neck, as well as areas north and east of Digby). Oil also strands on  islands and points of land along the outer coast of northern Maine between days 15 and 20, and  additional oiling of shorelines around Grand Manan has occurred. Due to stranding of some of the oil, the  remaining slicks become thinner, and continue to move northeast up the Nova Scotia side of the Bay of  Fundy through day 25. By day 25, most of the oil has stranded on shore, with oiling affecting most of the  Nova Scotia shoreline between Brier Island and Cape Split at the entrance to the Minas Basin. Some  floating oil has also entered the Minas Basin by day 25; however, the remaining oil slicks on the water  surface are all very thin by this time.

By  30 days after the release, approximately 161 km of shoreline would be oiled, representing about 2.5% of  the total shoreline length in the SAMAM. The information presented in Table 8-2 appears to represent a  small length of shoreline habitat in comparison with what appears to be a considerably longer length of  oiled shoreline after 30 days in Figure 8-1. The difference between these two presentation formats is due  to the patchy and irregular nature of shoreline oiling when simulated with high resolution. When mapped  at the scale shown in Figure 8-1, the fine-scale detail is lost; the oiling appears continuous when in fact it  is actually discontinuous. is 0\n",

      "Figure 8-2 shows the mass balance information for the fate of the simulated spill of HSB crude oil at  Location D. Of the total volume of 12,436 m3 assumed to be spilled, about 24% is estimated to be lost to  evaporation, and most of this loss occurs in the first 2 days following the release. Little evaporation is  predicted to occur after the first 5 days. The amount of oil left floating on the water surface declines  steadily over the first 12 days (as a result of both evaporation and stranding on shore). Between days  12 and 15, a larger amount of oil becomes stranded on shore, resulting in a period of rapid decrease in  the amount of oil left floating on the water. A second period of more rapid stranding of oil on shore occurs  between 21 and 25 days post-spill. About 14% of the oil becomes entrained or dissolved into the water  column. This amount rises steadily over the first 15 days, and levels off after that time. About 9% of the  spilled oil is lost to biodegradation in the first 30 days, most of which is predicted to occur in the first 5 to  10 days following the spill. As a result of these processes, less than 1% of the spilled oil remains floating  on the water surface at the end of 30 days. The HSB crude oil is not expected to weather to a density that  exceeds that of sea water, and as a result, the oil is not predicted to exhibit any sinking behaviour. is 0\n",

      "Figure 7-1 provides a series of images showing the results of the crude oil spill fate and transport  modelling at 5-day intervals up until 30 days after the time of the release. Oil on the water surface is  indicated as slicks that are likely very thin (thickness >0 to <2.0 µm when estimated as the volume of oil  divided by the area of a model grid cell) or thicker (≥2.0 µm thickness). The individual drawings also show  the areas of shoreline that have been exposed to oiling. On days 5 and 10, the surface oil slick remains  south of the spill location and is generally <2 µm in thickness. By day 15 much of the slick, while  remaining predominantly <2 µm in thickness, is expected to move north and be located between Grand  Manan and the Digby Neck. By day 30, the slick is expected to the east, south and west of Grand Manan,  with extensions into the Gulf of Maine predominantly as very thin slicks (<2 µm) in offshore areas. For the  30-day time period, shoreline oiling extends to the Grand Manan Archipelago, Brier Island, Digby Neck,  and the southwestern shore of Nova Scotia toward the Yarmouth area. is 0\n",

      "Figure 7-1 also shows the extent of shoreline oiling. By day 5, southern portions of the shoreline of Grand  Manan, as well as islands south of Grand Manan, have been oiled, in addition to shorelines along Digby  Neck and Brier Island. By day 10, additional oiling of many of these shoreline areas has occurred, and oil  is beginning to impinge on shorelines of southwestern Nova Scotia toward Yarmouth. Still further oiling of  these shorelines continues through day 30. Table 7-2 provides a summary of the length of oiled shoreline  at 5-day intervals following the release. The greatest amount of shoreline oiling occurs in the first 5 days,  with a reduced rate of oiling after that time. By 30 days after the release, it is estimated that roughly 124  km of shoreline would be oiled, representing about 2% of the total shoreline length in the SAMAM. is 0\n",

      "Figure 7-2 shows the mass balance information for the fate of the simulated spill of BAK crude oil south of  Grand Manan. Of the total volume of 12,436 m2 assumed to be spilled, more than 50% is estimated to be  lost to evaporation, and most of this loss occurs in the first 2 days following the release. Very little  evaporation occurs after the first 5 days. Most of the shoreline oiling occurs between the end of the  second day and day 10. By day 30, just under 20% of the spilled oil has stranded on shore. A relatively  large amount of the spilled oil (about 16%) becomes dissolved in the water, and this occurs primarily in  the first 5 days following the spill. About 3.2% of the spilled oil is subject to biodegradation in the first  30 days. As a result of the above processes, the total quantity of spilled oil remaining on the water  surface drops rapidly so that only about 11% remains on the water surface after 10 days. Due to the low  viscosity of the BAK crude oil, the oil in the surface of the water is subject to periodic episodes of  dispersion (as droplets) into the water column in response to episodes of higher wind speeds (and wave  action). The dispersed droplets rapidly re-surface when mixing conditions near the water surface abate.  These episodes are most noteworthy around day 2, days 14 to 19, and again on day 22 (Figure 7-2). A  small amount of oil (about 2.2% of the total volume spilled) is predicted to leave the model domain within  the first 30 days of the simulation. is 0\n",

      "Figure 7-5 shows the distribution of calculated likelihood of phototoxic effects on unpigmented larval fish  in near-surface (i.e., 0 to 1, and 1 to 5 depth strata) waters of the Bay of Fundy following the hypothetical  spill of BAK south of Grand Manan. As shown in Figure 7-5, the maximum predicted tissue concentration  measured as total phototoxic PAH equivalents (tpPAHeq) was 0.018 µmol/g wet weight. Further analysis  to evaluate the likelihood of exposure to UVA light indicated that there would be a moderate likelihood  (50% to 90%) of phototoxicity for a brief period of time (1 to 2 days) in a small area (about 12 km2 or 0.3%  of the total area of the SAMAM) south of Grand Manan, as well as a low likelihood (10% to 50%) of  phototoxicity in an additional area (about 271 km2 or 0.7% of the total area of the SAMAM), also south of  Grand Manan. Only a very small area of water (about 2.6 km2 or 0.01% of the total area of the SAMAM)  in the next depth stratum (1 to 5 m) showed a low likelihood of phototoxicity. Based on these results,  there is potential for an adverse environmental effect as a result of phototoxicity to larval fish and other  small, unpigmented marine fauna such as zooplankton, if they are present in the surface water layer  during daylight hours. This environmental effect would be limited to a small portion of the overall surface is 0\n",

The difference can be attributed to their low gradients, the  presence of lakes and much less deposited fine-grained glacial sediment than on  the western slopes (Carson et al. 1998). Carson et al. (1998) speculated that  tributaries on the east side of the Mackenzie River produce less than 5 Mt per  year.

Comparison of stream discharge shows that  mean annual flow was comparable for these years, though peak flow was 10% to  50% higher in 1974 than in 1973. As the spring freshet transports most of the  sediment load, sediment yield increased proportionately in spring. Although  Martin River, i.e., Station 10GC003, is a west-side tributary, it drains  considerably less mountainous terrain than other tributaries from the Mackenzie  Mountains and was included in the table for comparison. The Rengleng River  appears to have carried a very high sediment load of over 24,000 tonnes  (18 t/km2) in 1973, based on a partial record from that year. The published  volume, however, is only 6,610 tonnes (Environment Canada 2000) and  corresponds to a reduced yield of 5 t/km2, which is comparable to yields observed  in other basins. is 0\n",

The distance of 45 times bankfull width has been  used as the downstream extent at which sediment deposition is expected to occur.  This estimate was based on limited winter flow data and the assumption that  coarse silt was the particle size of interest. Peak concentrations at 45 times  bankfull width have been estimated at 0 to 390 mg/L for 2% fines depending on  the basin size. These concentrations include all fractions of silts and clays, and are  not limited to coarse silt. The distance of fine sediment deposition was estimated  based on available data and the assumption that 0.2 m of turbid water will be  cleansed by settling in quiet-water areas over 1 km of stream channel.

Therefore, the percentage of the provincial population for each bird KI that could be  affected by the Project is less than 1%. Many species, in particularly the raptors (goshawks and owls),  cranes and bitterns, occur at very low densities. Therefore, even if habitat loss is relatively high in the  PEAA, few individuals will be displaced.

The most toxic of the dioxins,  2,3,7,8–tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), was detectable in all samples, with concentrations ranging  from 0.12 to 0.21 pg/g (parts per trillion). The toxic equivalent (TEQ), a standard measure of the  combined toxicity of all dioxins and furans measured in a sample, was higher than the ISQG in all  samples and ranged from 1.24 to 2.34 using toxic equivalent factors for fish described in CCME (2004)  and up to 4.35 using various conventions for calculation (Van den Berg et al. 1998). The TEQ can be  reported in various ways, depending on how values reported as less than detection are treated in the  calculation, and which toxic equivalent factors are used (e.g., those for mammals, fish or humans).

These relatively small  exceedances of guidelines indicate baseline sources of metals, which are well within safety margins of the  guidelines.
