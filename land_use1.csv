This is a periodic seasonal concern not uncommon w ith culv erts.,"To help address this concern the top 2 culv erts (18 inch culv erts) on the access trail were remov ed and replaced w ith 24 inch culv erts.  The remov ed culverts were both installed upslope to further reduce and distribute flow s.  There are now a total of 7 cross-drain culv erts on the slope from about KP 22.500 to KP 23.000 (see Photos 9 and 10 in Section 5.2).
